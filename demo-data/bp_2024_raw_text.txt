b IFRS requires that the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker. For bp, this measure of profit or loss 
is replacement cost profit before interest and tax, which reflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is arrived at by excluding inventory holding gains and losses « from profit 
before interest and tax. Replacement cost profit for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS. For further information see Financial statements – Note 5.

Dear fellow shareholders,
Chief executive transition
The world bp operates in continues to change at 
pace. The past year has seen numerous 
elections, complex geopolitics and ongoing 
conflict, as well as significant climate events. At 
the same time, there has been progress in AI and 
technology and some signs of growth and 
prosperity in emerging economies. As a result, 
energy demand continues to rise with the supply 
of oil and gas, and renewable energy, reaching an 
all-time high.
For bp, there was leadership change, with a new 
CEO and CFO, and 2024 was a year of reshaping 
the portfolio and laying the foundation for growth 
and sustainable shareholder returns. Under 
Murray Auchincloss’s leadership, bp has made 
significant moves, continuing to play its part in 
supplying the energy the world needs today and 
helping build out the energy system of tomorrow. 
We strengthened our oil and gas portfolio, 
expanded in biogas and bioenergy, and focused 
our hydrogen and wind projects – all leading to 
the fundamental strategy reset announced at our 
Capital Markets Update in February 2025.
Performance 
Safety continues to be at the forefront of 
everything bp does, and the board and I would 
again like to recognize bp’s teams for their work 
to reduce the most serious process safety 
incidents. This requires constant vigilance, 
robust processes and a willingness to speak up 
and act. 
However, whether it is on the front line or on the 
board, bp can never take safety for granted. We 
were tragically reminded of this in October 2024 by 
the fatality in our bp bioenergy business in Brazil.Many of bp’s businesses performed well, 
including higher upstream « production and 
strong plant reliability «, but it was a difficult year 
in parts of our customers & products business, 
particularly in refining. bp cannot control a tough 
price environment but it can address underlying 
performance – and the board believes that the 
comprehensive update of our strategy that we 
announced in February, combined with strong 
performance management processes, will help 
bp to do this.
Strategy reset 
A lot has changed since we launched our 
strategy in 2020 – and bp has learned a lot. The 
pandemic has altered consumer behaviour, 
geopolitical tensions have increased the focus on 
security of supply, and although energy demand 
has risen to a high point, overall, growth has been 
weaker. Globally, inflation and rising interest 
rates have had an impact on the economics of 
major projects, particularly low carbon 
investments.
Because of all these factors, combined with our 
engagement with our shareholders and other 
important stakeholders, we reworked our 
strategy. Murray sets out how on the next page. 
This is a new direction for bp. The board has 
worked closely with Murray and his leadership 
team throughout this reset, which has our full 
support. The reset builds on bp’s distinctive 
strengths, learns from its challenges and 
represents deliberate choices and a conviction 
about the way forward. The next steps are clear. 
Now is about rigorous performance, and the 
board has an important role to play in overseeing 
the delivery of the strategy we have set out. Culture and values
The board believes that the changes bp is 
making are positive and necessary for the future 
of the company, but we know change itself can 
be unsettling. This makes it more crucial than 
ever that bp maintains a strong culture and 
strong values. bp is rigorous about operational 
and safety processes, and must continue to be 
rigorous about care for others, our speak-up 
culture and psychological safety. As a board, we 
provide oversight and constructive challenge, 
and in doing so we routinely monitor bp’s culture. 
I say more about this in the governance section 
on page 70 . 
Closing thanks 
Thank you, particularly to bp’s owners and bp’s 
teams, in a year where bp has faced numerous 
challenges and worked hard to improve its 
performance and focus the organization. We are 
grateful to everyone who has given us their time, 
expertise, support – and challenged us too. This 
is your company and we believe it is now set to 
grow – and win – in a changing energy market.

4 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024


Dear fellow shareholders,
We’ve been in action throughout the past year 
materially reshaping bp’s portfolio and laying the 
foundations for February’s Capital Markets 
Update. This fundamental reset of our strategy 
demonstrates a clear focus on actions to drive 
performance improvement and grow cash flow 
and returns for bp’s shareholders.
Safety first
In 2024, we made progress on safety, reducing 
the number of combined tier 1 and 2 process 
safety events « for a second year in a row, with 
the most serious tier 1 events down significantly 
– but we have more to do. Our goal is to 
eliminate fatalities, life-changing injuries and the 
most serious process safety incidents. Tragically, 
one person died while working in our newly 
acquired bp bioenergy business in Brazil in 
October 2024. We must continue to embed and 
reinforce our Operating Management System «, 
Lifesaving Rules and Safety Leadership 
Principles across bp (see  page 56 ). Nothing 
matters more than safety.
Financial and operating performance 
We delivered strong performance in some areas 
in 2024 but had some challenges in others. For 
example, our upstream « production was 2% 
higher than in 2023, and plant reliability « was 
strong at over 95%, but there were difficulties in 
refining. Margins were lower and the power 
outage at Whiting in the first quarter contributed 
to a dip to 94.3% in our refining availability «.
This contributed to earnings of $38 billiona 
(adjusted EBITDA «) in 2024 and operating cash 
flow« of $27.3 billion and resulted in: 
•Profit for the year attributable to 
shareholders of $0.4 billion.
•Underlying replacement cost profit « 
of $8.9 billion.
•Return on average capital employed « 
of 14.2%b.
•And net debt « of $23 billionc.
This allowed us to raise the dividend per ordinary 
share by 10% and announce $7 billion of share 
buybacks for the year.
Reshaping the portfolio
We’ve done more to reshape bp’s portfolio in the 
last 12 months than in any year in the past 20 
years. We started up a major project « and 
sanctioned 10. We agreed new access in regions 
we know well, including in Iraq and India – at 
material scale. We formed a new joint venture, 
Arcius Energy, to develop gas in the Middle East 
with ADNOC’s investment arm XRG. And we 
announced plans for JERA Nex bp, joining forces 
with one of the world’s major power companies 
to create a leader in offshore wind development – and helping to grow the scale of the business 
in a capital-light way for bp. We also now own 
100% of bp bioenergy, one of the top-three 
sugarcane bioethanol producers in Brazil, 
and Lightsource bp, one of the world’s leading 
solar developers. And we're investing with 
discipline in hydrogen and carbon capture, 
sanctioning four projects in 2024.
At the same time, we introduced our target to 
deliver at least $2 billion of savingsd by the end of 
2026, relative to 2023. We made strong progress 
on this, achieving structural cost reduction « of 
$0.8 billion since the start of 2024. 
Growing shareholder value 
Having laid the foundations, we have 
fundamentally reset our strategy. This is a new 
direction. We’ve drawn on everything we’ve 
learned since 2020, while reflecting substantial 
changes to the external environment and using 
our deep-seated industrial skills and experience. 
The key elements are:
•First, a growing upstream. We’re increasing 
planned investment by 20% to around $10 
billion a year in oil and gas to help build more 
higher-returning major projects and increase 
exploration. 
•Second, a focused downstream. We’re 
focusing our portfolio around core integrated 
positions and taking action to improve 
performance. We expect to invest around
$3 billion by 2027.
•Third, investing with discipline in the 
transition. We plan to pursue fewer and 
higher-returning opportunities, and access 
growth more efficiently. We now expect to 
invest between $1.5-2.0 billion per year into 
transition businesses « through 2027e – more 
than $5 billion lower per year than our 
previous guidance.All while continuing to drive value through our 
distinctive strengths in trading, technology and 
partnerships. And we are now guided by a more 
focused set of sustainability aims, the ones most 
relevant to our net zero ambition and the long-
term success of bp (see page 38 ). 
Thank you 
There are very few companies of scale that can 
adapt at pace with society to meet demand from 
countries, companies and customers for more 
energy and lower carbon products. bp is one 
of them. I’m excited about our new direction and 
the significant opportunity we have to grow value 
for our shareholders. 
I want to thank our brilliant team for their hard 
work, commitment and resilience through a 
period of extensive change. I also want to thank 
you, the owners of our business, for continuing to 
put your trust in our company.

The operating environment
bp operates across volatile energy markets. Here 
we discuss broader economic trends we have 
observed that influence our sector as a whole. 
The world economy grew by around 3%a in 2024. 
Growth rates varied widely across economies, 
with US GDP estimated to have grown by 2.8%a, 
much stronger than had been expected at the 
start of the yearb. By contrast, the eurozone 
economy expanded by only 0.8%a. China’s growth 
is estimated to have been close to the 
government’s ‘around 5%’ targeta.
Inflation continued to moderate around the world 
in 2024, moving towards central banks’ target 
rates in most major economies. Cooling inflation 
allowed several central banks, including the US 
Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and 
the Bank of England, to cut interest rates. 
Financial market prices suggest further interest 
rate reductions are expected during 2025.
Oil
Oil prices were elevated across much of 2024, 
supported by oil demand growth and OPEC 
production cuts. Dated Brent averaged $81/bblc in 
2024, broadly unchanged from $83/bblc in 2023. 
A slowdown in Chinese oil demand growth to a 
quarter of its pre-COVID trend lowered global 
annual oil demand growth to 0.94mmb/d, causing 
total oil demand in 2024 to be 102.9mmb/dd. 
The slowdown in demand growth and 
outperformance of non-OPEC+ supply led to 
production cuts from OPEC+ in 2024. OPEC+ 
output averaged 49.8mmb/d in 2024 – around 
900kb/dd lower than 2023. Saudi Arabia cut its 
output to just 9.0mmb/d in 2024, over 1mmb/d 
lower than its levels in the first half of 2023d. 
These reductions were more than offset by 
strong growth in non-OPEC+ supplies which 
increased by 1.5mmb/d in 2024d, with the US 
accounting for almost half of that increased.Natural gas
A relatively warm European winter in 2023-24 and 
muted European gas demand caused European 
and Asian natural gas prices to fall in early 2024. 
Prices troughed in February but had increased by 
70%e by the end of December following strong 
Asian LNG demand growth and weak LNG 
supply growth.
Industry, power generation and transportation 
were the main sectoral drivers of that Asian LNG 
demand growth. European gas demand 
continued to decline due to lower power demand. 
Outages and project delays meant global LNG 
supply grew at a slow pace of 2.5% in 2024f.
In the US, Henry Hub (HH) gas prices averaged 
$2.2/mmBtug, the lowest price level, in real terms, 
in the last 25 years. A warm US winter (2023-24) 
resulted in natural gas stocks 40%h above the five-
year average by the end of March. Consequently, 
HH declined to levels needed to incentivize power 
sector coal-to-gas switching and lower natural 
gas production. Increases in power demand for 
air conditioning and data centres aided this 
rebalancing. The number of US gas rigs in key 
shale basins declined by 47% from its peak in 
2022i.
Refining marker margin
We use a global refining marker margin (RMM) « 
to track the refining margin environment. Global 
RMM in 2024 continued the downward trajectory 
from 2023. An increase in refining capacity and a 
slowdown in demand growth for refined products 
meant RMM values averaged significantly lower in 
2024 at $17.7/bbl ($8.1/bbl lower than in 2023) j. 
Power and renewables
Electricity demand growth continues to outpace 
total energy demand growth, driven by increasing 
electrification in developed economies and bygrowing prosperity and industrialization in 
emerging economies. Growing demand from data 
centres looks set to increase electricity demand 
materially in the coming years.
Total solar and wind capacity additions in 2024 
are estimated to have exceeded 600GW, breaking 
the record set in 2023k. This surge was 
associated with significant overcapacity in solar 
manufacturing in China.
Bioenergy growth also maintained momentum, 
with resilient demand for liquid biofuels in road 
transport, increasing biomethane production, and 
increasing announced capacity of sustainable 
aviation fuel projects.
Hydrogen and carbon capture 
and storage
Persistent high costs, the slow pace of enabling 
policy and insufficient demand continue to 
challenge the decarbonization of costlier-to-abate 
processes with low carbon hydrogen. The project 
pipeline for production of low carbon hydrogen 
operational by 2030 remains significant, but only 
around 4Mtpal is either currently operational or 
under construction. Green hydrogen « costs are 
expected to be higher than those for blue 
hydrogen « in many countries through this 
decade and beyond. 
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is increasingly 
being recognized as critical to the energy 
transition, and the global pipeline of CCS projects 
continued to grow in 2024. Operational and 
under-construction projects are expected to 
double to 100Mtpam over the next few years. 
While this represents progress, the current project 
pipeline, taking into account relatively low 
historical success rates, appears insufficient to 
meet the CCS deployment rates in Paris-
consistent transition scenariosn.

Energy outlook
The bp Energy Outlook 2024 (2024 Outlook)  
explores the trends and uncertainties 
surrounding the energy transition out to 2050. 
The bp Energy Outlook  helps inform bp’s core 
beliefs about the energy transition. The scenarios 
within it explore the possible implications of 
different judgements and assumptions 
concerning the nature of the energy transition. 
The uncertainty associated with the transition is 
substantial, and these scenarios are not 
predictions of what is likely to happen or what bp 
would like to see happen. We use the output 
from these scenarios to inform our strategic 
thinking.
We published the  2024 Outlook in July 2024, 
designed around two scenarios informed by 
recent trends and developments in the global 
energy system. The  2024 Outlook  provides key 
insights about how the energy system may 
evolve over the next 25 years.
The two scenarios – Current Trajectory and Net 
Zero (see ‘Two scenarios to explore the energy 
transition’, below) – explore the speed and shape 
of the energy transition out to 2050 and help to 
shape a resilient strategy for bp.
Read the bp Energy Outlook 2024 
bp.com/energyoutlookA new theme discussed throughout the 2024 
Outlook  centres on the challenge of moving from 
the current ‘energy addition’ phase of the energy 
transition to an ‘energy substitution’ phase. In 
this second phase, low carbon energy increases 
sufficiently quickly to more than match increases 
in global energy demand, allowing the 
consumption of fossil fuels, and their associated 
emissions, to decline.
Scenarios for strategic 
decision making
We use scenarios to inform strategy, manage 
risk, and improve decision making.
Some of the scenarios are based on climate and 
other policies currently in force, and on current 
global aims and pledges around the energy 
transition. Other scenarios are based on 
achieving a certain pace or degree of transition, 
and consider how the energy system might 
change to achieve that.
In thinking about appropriate scenarios to inform 
our strategy, we used both approaches.
How scenarios inform our strategy  
The use of scenarios described in the 2024 
Outlook , and those from other organizations, aids 
our understanding of the energy transition and 
helps us to think about how different outcomes 
might impact our strategy.The use of a broad range of scenarios to inform 
our strategy supports our efforts to make it 
robust and resilient to the range of uncertainty 
we face. 
By considering various time horizons we can 
identify key milestones or signposts which might 
emerge over the next five, 10 or 25 years and 
inform our view of the key sources of uncertainty 
affecting the global energy system.
We actively monitor for changes in the 
external environment and refresh or review 
the scenarios as needed in response to 
these signals.
For the purposes of testing the resilience 
of our strategy to the range of uncertainty in 
the energy transition, we have used scenarios 
drawn from other credible sources such as the 
UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UN 
PRI) and the International Energy Agency (IEA). 
Read more on our resilience analysis and the 
outcome of that work on page 50 .
How we create scenarios
We quantify a range of scenarios in the 2024 
Outlook  using our global energy modelling 
system. This comprises a suite of models to help 
us understand the supply and demand dynamics 
of the global energy system.
The modelling framework uses historical data 
based on the Energy Institute’s Statistical Review 
of World Energy, the IEA’s World Energy Balances 
data and a range of other data sets.
Each scenario is determined by a set of key 
assumptions, including population and economic 
growth, pace of technological change, resource 
constraints and government policies. These are 
informed by expert analysis from external 
organizations including the United Nations, 
Oxford Economics and Rystad Energy. We 
benchmark our scenarios against external 
organizations including the IEA, the IPCC, and 
S&P Global.
The modelling techniques used vary by sector 
and include a combination of econometric 
modelling, adoption curves and consumer 
choice modelling.Strategic report

Current Trajectory 
 Net Zero 
is designed to capture the broad pathway 
along which the global energy system is 
currently travelling. It places weight on 
climate policies already in force and on 
global aims and pledges for future 
decarbonization. At the same time, it also 
recognizes the myriad challenges associated 
with meeting these aims. CO 2 equivalent

in the mid-2020s and by 2050 are around 
25% below 2022 levels.explores how different elements of the energy 
system might change to achieve a substantial 
reduction in carbon emissions. In that sense, 
Net Zero can be viewed as a ‘what if’ scenario: 
what elements of the energy system might 
change, and how, if the world collectively 
acts for CO 2e emissions to fall by around 95% 
by 2050.

Growing the upstream: our oil and gas business
We plan to increase investment to grow production while also growing cash 
flow, in addition to disciplined expansion of biogas. Maintaining strong and 
safe operations throughout.
Focusing the downstream: our customers and 
products business
We are reshaping the portfolio to focus on markets and businesses where 
we have advantaged and integrated positions. We have clear actions to 
drive improved performance, including addressing costs in our customers 
business, and improving operations in refining.Investing with discipline in transition
We plan to invest with discipline: with selective investment in biogas, 
biofuels and EV charging, where we see strong demand growth; adopting 
innovative capital-light partnerships in renewables; and focusing investment 
on hydrogen and carbon capture projects to support us in decarbonizing 
our operations, and position us for growth through the next decade. We 
now expect capital investment into transition businesses « to be between 
$1.5-2.0 billion per year through 2027a – more than $5 billion lower per year 
than our previous guidance.
All while continuing to drive value through our distinctive strengths in trading, technology and partnerships.
Our primary targets
We have set out four primary targets that we will use to measure our progress and how we are improving 
performance. These targets, alongside the guidance and financial frame (see page 18 ), support our reset. 
Taken together, we believe our primary targets will underpin growth in the value of bp.

Pursuing a strategy that is consistent with the Paris goals
What we mean by Paris-consistent 
The 2019 CA100+ resolution « requires us to 
disclose the strategy that the board considers in 
good faith to be consistent with the Paris goals.
When we refer to ‘consistency with Paris’ we 
consider this to mean consistency with the world 
meeting the temperature goal set out in Articles 
2.1(a) and 4.1 of the Paris Agreement on 
Climate Change «. 
The Paris goals, which we support, were restated 
in the Baku Climate Pact at COP29 in Baku in 
November 2024.
We believe the world is on an unsustainable path, 
and the carbon budget to meet the Paris goals is 
running out. 
bp’s strategy is informed by these 
considerations. It is designed to create long-term 
value for shareholders, while enabling delivery of 
our net zero ambition. It is tested for resilience to 
the uncertainty of the energy transition across 
many different potential pathways, including 
various Paris-consistent pathways.
In the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021  we 
set out, based on three key principles , why the 
board considers our strategy to be consistent 
with the Paris goals. Here we set out, on the 
same three grounds, why the board continues to 
consider this to be the case.
Informed by Paris-consistent energy 
transition scenarios
The speed and nature of the energy transition are 
uncertain, and so we consider a range of 
scenarios from multiple sources including the bp 
Energy Outlook 2024  to inform our beliefs about 
the energy transition and to develop and test our 
strategic thinking. This helps to reinforce our 
confidence in the robustness and resilience of 
our strategy to the range of uncertainty we face. We are confident that our approach is science-
based. We see the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) as the most authoritative 
source of information on the science of climate 
change, and we use it and other sources to 
inform our strategy. The IPCC highlights that 
there are a range of global pathways by which 
the world can meet the Paris goals, with differing 
implications for regions, industry sectors and 
sources of energy.
The bp Energy Outlook 2024  examined recent 
developments and emerging trends in the global 
energy system, exploring the key uncertainties 
surrounding the energy transition. It included two 
main scenarios – one of which, Net Zero, we 
regard as Paris-consistent. 
Energy outlook page 7  and 
bp.com/energyoutlook
Strategic resilience
We believe our strategy positions bp for success 
and resilience in a Paris-consistent world – a 
world that is progressing on one of the many 
global trajectories considered to be Paris-
consistent, and ultimately meets the Paris goals.
The strategy diversifies bp’s portfolio and 
business interests, reducing the risk that 
challenges facing a single business area might 
adversely affect bp’s strategic resilience. 
In addition, within the inevitable constraints 
associated with factors such as long-term capital 
investments, contractual commitments and 
organizational capabilities at any given time, bp’s 
ability to maintain its strategic resilience rests, in 
part, on the governance used to keep the 
strategy and associated targets and aims under 
review in light of new information and changes 
in circumstances. In our climate-related financial disclosures on 
page 50 , we describe how we have conducted an 
analysis to test our view of the resilience of our 
strategy, based on the Capital Markets Update 
presented on 26 February 2025, to different 
climate-related scenarios. This includes some 
scenarios that are classified by the World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD) to be consistent with well-below 2°C 
and 1.5°C outcomesa. 
As further explained on page 51 , while the results 
of any such analysis must be treated with 
caution overall, this resilience test again 
reinforced our confidence in the continued 
resilience of our strategy to a wide range of ways 
in which the energy system could evolve 
throughout this decade, including in scenarios 
consistent with limiting temperature rise 
to 1.5°C. 
The analysis also again highlighted that, while 
within the WBCSD scenarios lowest oil prices are 
associated with 1.5°C scenarios, there is 
considerable uncertainty – demonstrated by the 
range within, and overlap between, the prices 
indicated for each scenario family.
In the version of the WBCSD catalogue used for 
the analysis, the lowest oil price is associated 
with a 1.5°C scenario; however a number of the 
1.5°C and well-below 2°C scenarios have oil 
prices in 2030 that are substantially higher than 
these – and when compared to bp’s own central 
case oil price planning assumption for 2030, the 
oil price in a number of the well-below 2°C and 
1.5°C scenarios is also higher.
Taking this into account, the analysis supported 
our belief that our strategy is financially resilient 
against the lowest prices associated with a 
Paris-consistent world in the WBCSD catalogue. 
This in turn supports our view that our strategy is 
resilient to such a Paris-consistent world.Consistency with the Paris goals
10 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024a Our 2024 analysis used data from the WBCSD Climate Scenario Catalogue version 3.0, published on 16-05-2024 and downloaded on 13-11-2024.

Contributes to net zero 
We believe that our strategy enables bp to make 
a positive contribution to the world achieving net 
zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 
meeting the Paris goals – outcomes which we 
believe to be in the best interests of bp as well as 
beneficial to society generally. 
We see huge opportunity in the energy transition 
– the transformation of the energy system that 
we believe to be a necessary feature of the 
world’s efforts to meet the Paris goals. There are 
many ways a company at the heart of the energy 
sector can make a meaningful contribution to the 
world getting to net zero. In addition to investing 
in our transition businesses «, these include: 
supporting collective action through participation 
in external initiatives and seeking to use the 
company’s influence with trade associations that 
conduct climate-related advocacy; low carbon 
collaboration and support for others in their own 
decarbonization efforts (such as cities and 
corporates). 
For example, we continue to advocate for 
policies that support net zero. Helping 
policymakers to design and put in place low 
carbon policies that support the transition to net 
zero can help deliver our strategy and capitalize 
on the opportunities associated with achieving 
the Paris goals, but the benefit of such actions, if 
successful, extends well beyond any implications 
for bp’s own GHG metrics. That is because well-
designed low carbon policies can also advance 
the decarbonization of a whole economy – 
something potentially of far greater impact than 
anything a single company can achieve through 
its own portfolio. We publish examples of our 
activity online at bp.com/advocacyactivities .
Some ways of contributing  to helping the world 
get to net zero are more readily measured by 
quantitative metrics than others – but all can be 
important, whether or not they translate into GHG 
reductions for bp. For example, Lightsource bp 
operates with a develop, engineer, construct and 
farm-down business model that creates value 
through selling majority interests in assets it has 
developed to strategic partners. Where Lightsource bp helps bp meet its own 
demand for cost competitive, low carbon power, 
including for power trading, EV charging, biofuels 
and green hydrogen « this would show up in GHG 
metrics. However, where we do not directly sell 
that power, our development of the renewables is 
effectively ‘invisible’ in terms of our GHG metrics.
In December 2024, in Teesside, UK, bp and 
partners reached financial close on the Net Zero 
Teesside Power (NZT Power) and Northern 
Endurance Partnership (NEP) projects. The NEP 
aims to develop the infrastructure to transport 
and store up to an initial 4MtCO 2 annually from 
three Teesside-based carbon capture projects 
within the East Coast Cluster, with the ability to 
expand in the future. 
Responding to increased shareholder interest in Paris consistency
In 2019 the board recommended that shareholders support a special resolution requisitioned by 
Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) on climate change disclosures. The CA100+ resolution passed with 
more than 99% of votes cast. This is the sixth year we have included responses throughout the annual 
report and we have adopted a similar approach to previous years. 
The CA100+ resolution, which includes safeguards such as protections for commercially confidential 
and competitively sensitive information, is on page 352 . Key terms related to this resolution response 
are indicated with « and defined in the glossary on page 352 . These should be reviewed with the 
following information:

Projects take many years to complete, requiring 
differing amounts of resource, so a smooth or

to be of strategic importance to bp, or of a high 
degree of complexity.

Underlying RC profit « (non-IFRS) is a useful 
measure for investors because it is one of the 
profitability measures bp management uses to 
assess performance. It assists management in 
understanding the underlying trends in operational 
performance on a comparable year-on-year basis. It 
reflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in 
the period and is arrived at by adjusting for inventory 
holding gains and losses «, net impact of adjusting 
items« and related taxation from profit or loss 
attributable to bp shareholders.
2024 performance
Profit for 2024 attributable to bp shareholders 
includes pre-tax net impairment charges of 
$5.1 billion. Reduction in the underlying RC profit 
reflects lower refining margins, lower 
realizations «, a lower gas marketing and trading 
result and a lower oil trading contribution, partly

Total shareholder return (TSR) represents the 
change in value of a bp shareholding over a 
calendar year (American Depositary Share (ADS) 
in USD, ordinary share in GBP). It assumes that 
dividends are reinvested to purchase additional 
shares at the closing price on the ex-dividend 
date.

2024 performance
Profit for 2024 attributable to bp shareholders 
was $0.4 billion and total equity at 31 December 
2024 was $78.3 billion. ROACE for 2024 reflected 
lower refining margins, lower realizations, a 
lower gas marketing and trading result and a 
lower oil trading contribution, partly offset by 
lower taxation.Strategic report

Scope 1 (direct) 
emissionsScope 2 (indirect) 
emissions
We report Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions material to our business on a 
carbon dioxide-equivalent basis. This KPI 
comprises Scope 1 (from running the assets 
within our operational control boundary) and 
Scope 2 (associated with importing electricity, 
heating and cooling that is bought in to run 
those operations) data covered by our net zero 
operations aim (to be net zero across our 
operations by 2050 or sooner). It comprises 
100% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions or activities 
within bp’s operational control boundary.
2024 performance
In 2024 our Scope 1 (direct) emissions were 
32.8MtCO 2e – an overall increase from 
31.1MtCO 2e in 2023. Of these Scope 1 
emissions, 31.4MtCO 2e were carbon dioxide and 
1.5MtCO 2e were methanec. Overall emissions 
increased due to project start-ups, operational 
growth in our low carbon businesses, temporary 
operational changes and operational issues in 
Tangguh, partially offset by the delivery of 
emissions reduction projects. In 2024 our Scope 
2d (indirect) emissions, covered by bp’s net zero 
operations « aim, decreased by 0.2MtCO 2e, to 
0.8MtCO 2e, compared with 2023. The continued 
use of lower carbon power agreements and a 
project at our Gelsenkirchen refinery to replace 
imported steam contributed to this decrease, see 
page 38 .
Basis of calculatione
bp’s reported GHG emissions include methane 
(CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). Other GHGs are 
not included as they are not material to our 
operations. CH 4 emissions are converted to CO 2 
equivalent using the 100-year global warming 
potential recommended by the Fifth Assessment 
Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC).
Data is required to be submitted into the bp 
group reporting tool, OneCSR, in accordance 
with bp’s Operating Management System 
(OMS)« requirements, broadly based on the GHG 
Protocol Corporate Standard and the Ipieca 
Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2nd Edition, May 
2011. The responsibility for quantifying and 
submitting GHG emissions for reporting is 
assigned to individual bp facilities and business 
departments, which are termed reporting 
units (RUs). Methane intensityaf (%)TCFD

We define methane intensity « as the amount of 
methane emissions from our upstream oil and 
gas operations as a percentage of the gas that 
goes to market from those operations. This 
applies to methane emissions within our 
operational control boundary, where we have the 
highest degree of control. Methane emissions 
from non-producing activities, such as 
exploration drilling, are excluded. In 2024 we 
started reporting methane intensity based on our 
new measurement approach across our major 
operated oil and gas assets.
2024 performance
Our methane intensity was 0.07% in 2024f. 
Methane emissions from upstream operations 
used to calculate this methane intensity 
increased by around 48% from 31kt in 2023 to 
46kt in 2024, see page 39 .
Basis of calculatione
All operated upstream assets report methane 
(CH 4) emissions on a 100% basis, including 
emissions from operated upstream oil and gas 
and also includes terminals and LNG facilities. 
Marketed gas production: all upstream gas 
reaching a market from bp-operated upstream 
assets, whether or not this is bp-owned product, 
and includes gas production from natural gas 
wells and associated gas from oil production 
wells. Throughput from bp-operated oil and gas 
terminals is excluded to avoid double counting 
despite their associated CH 4 emissions being 
included in the metric. CH 4 data is required to be 
submitted into the bp group reporting tool, 
OneCSR, in accordance with OMS requirements, 
broadly based on the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Standard and the Ipieca Petroleum Industry 
Guidelines for Reporting Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions 2nd Edition, May 2011. The 
responsibility for quantifying and submitting CH 4 
emissions for reporting is assigned to individual 
bp facilities and business departments (RUs).

Our people are crucial to delivering our purpose 
and strategy. We aim to recruit talented people 
with diverse perspectives, backgrounds, skills 
and experiences, invest in their development and 
promote an inclusive culture.
Each year we report the percentage of women 
and individuals from countries other than the UK 
and the US among bp’s group leaders. 
2024 performance

b  Subject to board discretion each quarter, taking into account factors including outlook for cash flow, share count reduction from buybacks and maintaining ‘A’ range credit metrics. 
c  Includes offsetting any dilution from employee share schemes over time.
Resilient dividend
We continue to maintain a resilient dividend 
policy within our disciplined financial frame. 
Since the fourth quarter of 2023 our dividend per 
ordinary share has grown by 10% to 8.00 cents.
Based on our current forecasts and subject to 
the board’s discretion each quarter, we expect 
increases in the dividend per ordinary share of 
at least 4% per annum.
Stronger balance sheet
We are committed to strengthening the balance 
sheet and are now targeting net debt of between 
$14-18 billion by the end of 2027. Any potential 
proceeds from the strategic review of Castrol  
and Lightsource bp transactions will be 
dedicated to strengthening the balance sheet.
For the full-year 2024, finance debt increased 
from $52.0 billion at the end of 2023 to 
$59.5 billion, primarily reflecting net long-term 
debt issuances, and net debt increased from 
$20.9 billion to $23.0 billion.Disciplined investment allocation
We will continue to invest with discipline, driven 
by value, and focused on delivering returns.
Investment is allocated across our businesses 
based on a set of criteria that balances strategic 
alignment, hurdle rates, volatility, integration 
value, sustainability and risk (see page 22 ).
In 2024 capital expenditure « was $16.2 billion. 
We expect capital expenditure to be around 
$15 billion in 2025 and our capital expenditure 
frame for 2026 and 2027 is reduced to $13-15 
billion per annum. This includes expenditure on 
inorganic opportunities. Within the capital frame, 
on average ~$10 billion per year will be allocated 
to oil and gas, of which ~70% is expected to be 
allocated to oil and 30% to gas. In customers and 
products, we are progressively focusing capital 
expenditure from ~$4 billion in 2024 to ~$3 
billion by 2027. In low carbon energy, we expect 
capital expenditure, on average, will be less than 
$800 million per year through 2027, around half 
of which is allocated to hydrogen and CCS 
projects already through FID. Share buybacks
Share buybacks remain a core part of our 
investor proposition. Our intention remains 
to share excess cash with investors through 
buybacks. Subject to board discretion, we 
expect total distributions, including dividend 
and buyback, to be in the range of 30-40% of 
operating cash flow over time, including 
buybacks to offset dilution from employee 
share schemes.
We announced share buybacks of $7 billion for 
2024 and between the end of the first quarter 
2021 and 31 December 2024, we have reduced 
our shares in issue by 22%.
In setting the dividend per ordinary share and 
buyback each quarter, the board will continue 
to take into account factors including the 
cumulative level of and outlook for cash flow, 
share count reduction from buybacks and 
maintaining 'A’ range credit rating metrics.Our financial frame

How we use price assumptions 
Our price assumptions are used for our 
investment appraisal processes. They are also 
used to inform decisions about internal planning 
and the value-in-use impairment testing of 
assets for financial reporting. 
The role of price assumptions 
Our decisions on individual investments are 
informed by our view of the price environment 
and consider the balanced investment criteria 
discussed below. 
Our price assumptions continue to reflect a 
range of possibilities, including that the transition 
to a lower carbon economy and energy system 
could accelerate. Our investment appraisal 
assumptions, which take a long-term 
perspective, focus on the fundamental trends 
affecting the energy sector and our businesses. 
From January 2024 until January 2025, we held 
our key investment appraisal price assumptions 
constant at the levels set out in the bp Annual 
Report and Form 20-F 2023 . For relevant 
investment cases assessed from February 2025, 
we have applied and plan to apply the prices 
shown in the key investment appraisal 
assumptions table (right) for our central price 
case. Brent oil and Henry Hub gas assumptions 
average around $64/bbl and $4.0/mmBtu 
respectively (2023 $ real) from 2025 to 2050. 
We consider these prices to be broadly consistent 
with a range of transition paths compatible with 
meeting the Paris goals, but they do not 
correspond to any specific Paris-consistent 
scenario. We also consider a range of other price 
assumptions in investment appraisals, including 
product and market-specific prices relevant to 
individual investment cases. 
We apply carbon prices rising from $50/tCO 2e 
in 2025 to $135/tCO 2e in 2030 and $200/tCO 2e 
by 2050 (2023 $ real) in certain cases (see 
box, right). Impairment testing
Our best estimate of future prices for use in 
value-in-use impairment testing continues to be 
based on our investment appraisal price 
assumptions, with quarterly review of near-term 
prices to confirm that the assumptions 
appropriately reflect any changes to expectations 
due to short-term market trends.
Impairment price assumptions were held 
constant in 2024 at the levels disclosed in the  bp 
Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023  until the 
fourth quarter, when the updated investment 
appraisal price assumptions shown below were 
used for value-in-use impairment testing.

operational emissions costs that may be borne 
by bp as a result of an investment are included 
as bp costs, as described in the box below 
(generally without assuming incremental revenue 
associated with those emissions), in order to 
incentivize engineering solutions that reduce 
operational carbon emissions on projects. For 
the treatment of emission cost assumptions in 
value-in-use impairment testing, see Financial

Recommendations and Recommended 
Disclosures in relation to Metrics 
and TargetsOur investment process
20 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 
Investment process price assumptions
All investments are evaluated against relevant 
price assumptions for oil, natural gas, refining 
margins or other commodities across a range 
of alternative price or margin series (typically a 
central, upper and lower series). In addition, all 
investment cases with anticipated annual 
operational GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) 
above 20,000 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent (bp 
net), must estimate those anticipated GHG 
emissions and include an associated carbon 
cost in the investment economics, using the 
carbon prices above. 
Our investment price assumptions place some 
weight on scenarios in which the transition to 
a low carbon energy system is sufficiently 
rapid to meet the goals of the Paris 
Agreement, as well as scenarios in which the 
transition may not be sufficiently rapid. They 
also place some weight on a range of other 
factors that can drive prices, and which are 
not directly related to the Paris goals. These price assumptions do not link to specific 
scenarios or outcomes, but instead try to 
capture the range of different possibilities 
surrounding the future path of the global 
energy system. The nature of the uncertainty 
means that the price ranges inevitably reflect 
considerable judgement. The ranges are 
reviewed and updated as necessary, as our 
understanding of and judgements about the 
energy transition evolve. 
In addition to consideration of a range of price 
assumptions, investment cases also assess 
the impact of alternative assumptions 
covering other selected variables relevant to 
the economics of the investment. These 
variables may include cost, schedule, 
resources, policy changes, or other areas of 
uncertainty, to assess the robustness of 
investment cases to a range of other factors.

Investment governance and 
evaluating consistency with the 
Paris goals
Governance framework
bp’s framework for investment governance seeks 
to ensure that investments align with our 
strategy, can be accommodated within our 
prevailing financial frame, and add shareholder 
value. It enables investments to be assessed in a 
consistent way against a range of criteria 
relevant to our strategy, including environmental 
and other sustainability criteria. 
Investments follow an integrated stage-gate 
process designed to enable our businesses to 
choose and develop the most attractive 
investment cases. A balanced set of investment 
criteria is used (see page 22 ). This allows for the 
comparison and prioritization of investments 
across a diverse range of business models. 
The governance framework specifies that 
proposed investments are evaluated using 
relevant assumptions, including carbon prices for 
projected operational emissions where 
applicable. It also sets out requirements for 
assurance by functions independent of the 
business before a final investment decision (FID) 
is taken. 
The role of the board
The board assesses capital allocation across 
the bp portfolio, including the level and mix of 
capital expenditures « and divestments, strategic 
acquisitions, distribution choices and 
deleveraging, as well as reviewing certain 
investment cases for approval.
Resource commitment meeting 
For acquisitions and organic capital investments 
above defined financial thresholds, investment 
approval is conducted through the executive-
level resource commitment meeting (RCM), 
which is chaired by the chief executive officer. 
The RCM reviews the merits of each investment 
case against a balanced set of criteria (see page 
22) and considers any key issues raised in the 
assurance process. 
The CA100+ resolution « requires bp to disclose 
how we evaluate the consistency of new material 
capex investments « with (i) the Paris goals 
and (ii) a range of other outcomes relevant to 
bp’s strategy.
bp’s evaluation of the consistency of such 
investments with the Paris goals was undertaken 
by the RCM for new material capex investments 
sanctioned in  2024 (see page 23 ).
bp’s evaluation of an investment’s consistency 
with ‘a range of other relevant outcomes’ is 
achieved by considering its merits against bp’s 
balanced investment criteria, described on 
page 22 . bp board
Reviews and approves investment cases of more 
than $3 billion for resilient hydrocarbons, more 
than $1 billion for all transition or low carbon 
investments « and any significant inorganic 
acquisition that is exceptional or unique in nature.

In 2024 transition growth investment «a was 
$3.7 billion, compared to $3.8 billion in 2023 
(see page 39 ).
Bioenergy:  Our biogas operation, Archaea 
Energy, continued its growth and using its 
modular plant design it started up nine new 
renewable natural gas (RNG) « plants in 2024 
(see page 33 ).
EV charging:  Together with our strategic 
convenience site « networks, our investment in 
EV charging is helping us to offer lower carbon 
mobility solutions to more customers. In 2024 
examples include the opening of our standalone 
Aral EV charging Gigahub , in Germany, with 28 
charge points. And in China, bp pulse  installed 
2MWh batteries at a charging hub in Shenzhen. 
We continue to build scale in our EV charging 
network in key markets (see page 33 ). 
Convenience:  In 2024 we continued strategic 
investment in support of high-grading our 
retail fuels and convenience portfolio, including 
continued investment in TravelCenters of 
America, which bp acquired in 2023 (see 
page 33 ).
Hydrogen and CCS:  We are high-grading and 
focusing our hydrogen portfolio – prioritizing 
projects in jurisdictions where we have an 
adequate regulatory framework, access to 
the value chain – including our own or customer 
demand – linkage to carbon capture and 
access to competitive renewable power. 
In 2024 we made final investment decisions 
on four hydrogen/CCS projects (see page 29 ). 
For example we were granted funding to help 
support the development of a 100MW green 
hydrogen « project next to our Lingen refinery 
in Germany. The plant could produce up to 
11,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually. 
The final investment decision was taken in 
December 2024. 
Renewables & power:  In April 2024 we 
announced that we took ownership of Equinor’s 
50% stake in the Beacon Wind US offshore wind 
projects. In December we announced that bp 
and JERA Co., Inc will, subject to regulatory 
approvals and closing conditions being met, join 
forces to create a global wind joint 
venture« (see  page 28 ). 
Low carbon activity investment 
In 2024 low carbon activity investment «, 
a subset of our total transition growth 
investment, accounted for 80% of our total 
transition growth investment (67% in 2023). 
It increased from $2.5 billion in 2023 to 
$3.0 billion in 2024, reflecting higher investment 
in bioenergy, EV charging and wind businesses.Strategic report

Balanced investment criteria
All investment cases must set out their 
investment merits and are considered against a 
set of six balanced investment criteria –although 
investment decisions may also take other factors 
into account as appropriate. This standardized 
approach is intended to create a level playing 
field for decision making and allows portfolio-
wide comparisons of investment cases. The 
decision to endorse an investment based on the 
information provided represents our evaluation 
that it is consistent with what the 2019 CA100+ 
resolution « refers to as ‘a range of other 
outcomes relevant to bp’s strategy’. 
The six balanced investment criteria are:
Strategic alignment:  For all investment cases, 
we consider whether the investment supports 
delivery of our strategy, including our net zero 
aims. We also assess if the investment case 
involves distinctive capability that bp has, or 
intends to develop, and whether it adds to an 
existing ‘scale’ business within the portfolio or 
could help us create one. 
Safety and risks:  For all investment cases, we 
provide an assessment of the key risks to the 
investment that have a significantly higher 
probability than usual or have a significantly 
greater impact (relative to the size of the project) 
were they to occur. Safety risk management at 
bp is underpinned by our Operating Management 
System (OMS) «, which is designed to help us 
sustainably deliver safe, reliable and compliant 
bp operations. 
Sustainability:  For all investment cases, we 
consider how any proposed business opportunity 
is connected to the energy transition, societal 
needs and the environment. This approach is 
underpinned by our purpose and sustainability 
frame. All RCM cases must consider significant 
impacts of an investment on key sustainability 
aims, informed by our sustainability assessment 
template for investment cases (for our use of 
carbon prices, see box on page 20 ).
Investment economics:  For all investment 
cases, we consider investment economics 
against a range of relevant measures. Depending 
on the nature of the investment case, these may 
include return expectations (e.g. internal rate of 
return or IRR), net present value, discounted 
payback and profitability index, reflecting 
assumptions about relevant commodity prices, 
margins and carbon prices (see page 20 ). The 
forward economics of an investment case are 
considered against the differentiated IRRs 
applicable to that case at the time of the 
investment decision, depending on the business. 
We also refer to these expectations as hurdle 
rates; although, as noted, each case is assessed 
according to its combined merit against our full 
set of balanced criteria. 1. For our upstream business (including biogas), 
we seek an IRR of 15%. 
2. For our downstream business (including EV 
charging and biofuels), we seek portfolio-level 
returns in excess of 15%. 
3. For hydrogen and CCS, we expect levered 
returns in the mid-teens including farm-down 
and integration value.
For each investment, the relevant return 
expectations above are assessed using our 
central price assumptions. For additional capital 
discipline for investments in oil and gas 
production, we also compare the central price 
hurdle above (15%) to a case in which the Brent 
oil price starts at $60/bbl and later declines to 
the level of our key appraisal assumptions by 
2050 (see page 20 ). In addition, for investments 
in our oil and gas and refined products 
businesses, as well as any other investments 
that do not fall within one of the specific 
businesses set out above, we compare the IRR 
in our lower-price case to a cost of capital 
hurdle rate.
Volatility and rateability:  Our investment 
economics metrics also consider the degree of 
uncertainty of the cash flows when considering 
investment cases. For example, some cases 
have more certainty of future costs and revenue 
projections. Variation in net present values for 
the key variables in an investment case are 
quantified by sensitivity analysis to give a range 
of potential outcomes against our key 
investment hurdles. 
Optionality and integration: Our assessment 
considers the degree of optionality offered by a 
project – the ability to adapt our business to 
changing circumstances. This could be an option 
to sell a product with a floor price, or the right to 
purchase additional equity in a joint venture at 
specific terms. Other types of options include the 
right to develop (or not develop) extensions to 
existing projects, or to change the course of a 
project’s development depending on market 
circumstances. We likewise seek out integration 
along value chains across multiple products, 
services, geographies and customers. For 
example, our gas production can supply 
liquefaction plants whose LNG is monetized 
by our trading business. Likewise, carbon 
sequestration projects may allow us to add 
value to our gas production by reducing 
carbon intensity.Paris consistency evaluation process
Our new material capex investments « are 
intended to support the delivery of bp’s strategy.
For evaluations conducted in 2024, investments 
in scope for evaluation were defined as: 
•New:  investment in a new project, or 
extension of an existing project/asset, or 
share of an entity that is new to bp, or a 
substantial increase in bp’s share. 
•Material:  more than $250 million capex 
investment. 
Quantitative evaluations
For our investment economics and sustainability 
investment criteria we considered quantitative 
guide levels, as set out below, to inform the 
evaluation of each investment’s consistency with 
the goals of the Paris Agreement. For evaluations 
in 2024 we used the central price IRR and other 
economic hurdles as set out in the bp Annual 
Report and Form 20-F 2023  (page 32). As in 
previous years, we reduced our operational 
carbon intensity « guide levels, in line with our 
decreasing portfolio average. As our approach 
matures with experience, we may continue to 
adjust or supplement our methodology. There 
may be instances when new material capex 
investments are evaluated as consistent with 
the Paris goals despite either the economic or 
sustainability guide levels not being met. The 
RCM may also take account, in its Paris 
consistency evaluation, of the six balanced 
investment criteria using qualitative 
assessments. 
Investment economics: We calculated economic 
indicators using our central price, and where 
applicable, our lower price cases, and applying 
our carbon price assumptions to relevant 
operational GHG emissions. (For our current key 
central case oil and natural gas price 
assumptions, see page 20 , where we also set out 
our view on their consistency with achieving the 
Paris goals). We then compared the economic 
indicators to the relevant economic guide level 
(see below), based on the corresponding hurdles. 
We typically target a threshold of >1.0x the 
relevant IRR guide level, and <1.0x any relevant 
payback guide level, as set out in the bp Annual 
Report and Form 20-F 2023  (page 32).
Sustainability:  Where appropriate, we compared 
the expected operational carbon intensity of the 
investment relative to that of the portfolio 
average shown in the bp ESG Datasheet 2023 for 
the segment or the related business activity 
(upstream and refining). We normally target a 
ratio of less than 100%, meaning that the 
investment is expected to reduce the average 
operational carbon intensity of the relevant 
portfolio. The potential impact of new material 
capex investments on bp’s net zero aims is a 
further consideration.Our investment process continued

Evaluation outcome 
In 2024 eight new material capex investments were approveda. All were evaluated as being consistent with the Paris goals, taking into account both 
quantitative and qualitative evaluations and the balanced criteria above.
Evaluation of investment performance against quantitative guide levelsb
Seven of the eight investments exceeded the relevant IRR guide level as shown in the chart. The IRR of the remaining investment was slightly below 
its central price IRR hurdle. 
Three of the four upstream hydrocarbon projects had emissions intensities below the relevant upstream intensity guide level. The other upstream 
investment had an emissions intensity above the guide level, but was expected to reduce our operational emissions intensity in the region. The four 
other investments were in businesses for which there was no applicable carbon intensity guide. These latter investments are shown as ‘n/a’ in the 
operational carbon intensity chart.

Decisions taken in 2024
In 2024 there were eight new material capex investment decisions evaluated for Paris consistency, shown here in the order the investment decisions were made:
Brazilian biofuels: In June bp agreed to take full 
ownership of our Brazilian biofuels joint venture, 
acquiring Bunge’s 50% interest. The acquisition is 
expected to have capacity to produce around 
50,000 barrels a day of ethanol equivalent from 
sugar cane through the business’s 11 agro-
industrial units across five Brazilian states.
Kaskida: In July bp approved its final investment 
decision in the Kaskida project in the US Gulf of 
America. The new floating platform is expected to 
have nameplate production capacity of 80,000 
barrels of oil per day. It will leverage simplified, 
standardized and cost-efficient design, which is 
expected to be replicated in future projects. 
Ruwais LNG: In July bp announced we had 
agreed to take a 10% interest in a new ADNOC-
operated LNG facility in Abu Dhabi, deepening our 
relationship with our longstanding partner. The 
project has a planned total capacity of 9.6Mtpa. 
The investment is consistent with bp’s strategy to 
develop competitive gas positions as we grow our 
LNG portfolio.Coconut gas development: In August bp and 
EOG agreed to form a 50:50 joint venture for the 
Coconut development with EOG as operator. This 
partnership for the Coconut development is part 
of bpTT’s strategy to grow its gas business and 
help to unlock the energy future of Trinidad 
and Tobago.
Tangguh UCC:  In November bp and partners 
gave the go-ahead for the Tangguh UCC project in 
Papua Barat, Indonesia. The project has three 
components: the Ubadari field; a gas compression 
facility; and a carbon capture, use and storage 
(CCUS) project. It has the potential to unlock 
around 3 trillion cubic feet of additional gas 
resources in Indonesia to help meet growing 
energy demand in Asia. The CCUS component is 
expected to sequester around 15MtCO 2 during its 
initial phase from Tangguh’s natural gas 
production, reducing overall CO 2 emissions 
intensity from operations at Tangguh.
Northern Endurance Partnership (NEP): 
In December bp and partners made their final 
investment decision for NEP, a joint venture 
between bp, Equinor and TotalEnergies, which is 
the CO 2 transportation and storage provider for 
the UK’s East Coast Cluster (ECC). The Teesside onshore NEP infrastructure is 
expected to serve the Teesside-based carbon 
capture projects – NZT Power, H2Teesside and 
Teesside Hydrogen CO 2 Capture. We expect 
around 4MtCO 2 per year from these projects will 
be transported and stored from 2027.
Net Zero Teesside Power (NZT Power): 
Also in December bp and partners took a final 
investment decision in NZT Power, a joint venture 
between bp and Equinor, which could generate 
up to 742MW of flexible, dispatchable low carbon 
power. Up to 2MtCO 2 per year will be captured at 
the plant, and then transported and securely 
stored in subsea storage sites in the North Sea.
Lingen Green Hydrogen: In December bp 
made a final investment decision for the Lingen 
Green Hydrogen project in Germany, which will be 
its first fully-owned and operated large-scale green 
hydrogen « facility. The project is expected to 
install a 100MW electrolyser capacity capable of 
producing an average of 10-11kt of green 
hydrogen per year from 2027. The renewable 
power needed for the electrolyser is expected to 
be supplied by offshore wind generation. Strategic report

a The RCM also approved two investment cases in our low carbon energy business with capital investment above $250 million, which are not included in the evaluation information presented above. 
This is because one did not reach a final investment decision during 2024 and the other was a transaction to progress certain bp low carbon energy assets by contributing them to a joint venture. All of 
the assets that were material had been previously disclosed as new material capex investments in bp’s Annual Report and Form 20-F for the relevant year.
b The 2024 investments have been compared to relevant guides (as applicable to the evaluation of each investment) and are presented here in order of the ratio to the relevant central-price case IRR 
guide level (or where there was no relevant central price IRR guide level, the lower price one), and separately in order of the ratio to the relevant emissions intensity guide level. As a result, the 
evaluations against the economic and sustainability benchmarks do not necessarily follow the same order. 

bp delivered operating cash 
flow of $27.3 billion. During 
the year, we made strong 
progress on cost savings, 
achieving $0.8 billion of 
structural cost reduction «. 
We raised the dividend per 
ordinary share by 10% and 
delivered $7 billion of share 
buybacks. Our focus on 
capital discipline and 
strengthening the balance 
sheet continues into 2025.

At 31 December 2024 the group's reportable 
segments are gas & low carbon energy, oil 
production & operations and customers & 
products. Each is managed separately, with 
decisions taken for the segment as a whole, and 
represent a single operating segment that does 
not result from aggregating two or more 
segments. See Financial statements – Note 5 
Segmental analysis.  
Results 
The profit for the year ended 31 December 2024 
attributable to bp shareholders was $0.4 billion, 
compared with $15.2 billion in 2023. Adjusting 
for inventory holding losses, RC profit was $0.8 
billion, compared with $16.2 billion in 2023.
After adjusting RC profit for a net adverse impact 
of items, which bp has classified as adjusting 
(adjusting items) of $8.2 billion (on a post-tax 
basis), underlying RC profit for the year ended 
31 December 2024 was $8.9 billion. The result 
reflected lower refining margins, lower 
realizations, a lower gas marketing and trading 
result and a lower oil trading contribution, partly 
offset by lower taxation.
For 2023, after adjusting RC profit for a net 
favourable impact of adjusting items of $2.3 
billion (on a post-tax basis), underlying RC profit 
was $13.8 billion. The result reflected lower 
realizations, the impact of portfolio changes, the 
impact of lower refining margins and a lower oil 
trading performance.
For a discussion of bp’s financial and operating 
performance for the years ending 31 December 
2022 and 31 December 2023, see  bp Annual 
Report and Form 20-F 2023 , pages 35-47.
Adjusting items
In 2024 the net adverse pre-tax impact of items, 
which bp has classified as adjusting (adjusting 
items) was $9.3 billion including:
•Adverse fair value accounting effects (FVAEs) 
relative to management’s measure of 
performance of $1.9 billion primarily due to an 
increase in the forward price of LNG during 
2024, compared to a decline in 2023 and the 
adverse impact of the fair value accounting 
effects relating to the hybrid bonds in 2024 
compared to the favourable impact in 2023.
• Net impairment and losses on sale of 
businesses and fixed assets includes a loss 
of $1.1 billion relating to the sale of the 
ground fuels business in Türkiye (see 
Financial statements– Note 2 ) and net 
impairment charges of $5.1 billion (see 
Financial statements– Note 4 ). 
•In addition, $0.5 billion net impairment 
charges were reported through equity-
accounted earnings (reported within the 
‘other’ category).•The other category also includes a $0.5 billion 
gain relating to the remeasurement of bp's 
pre-existing 49.97% interest in Lightsource bp 
and a $0.5 billion gain relating to the 
remeasurement of certain US assets 
excluded from the Lightsource bp acquisition 
(see Financial statements –  Note 3  for further 
information); and recognition of onerous 
contract provisions related to the 
Gelsenkirchen refinery. The unwind of these 
provisions will be reported as an adjusting 
item as the contractual obligations are 
settled.
In 2023 the net favourable pre-tax impact of 
adjusting items was $1.1 billion including:
•Favourable FVAEs relative to management’s 
measure of performance of $9.4 billion 
primarily due to a decline in the forward price 
of LNG during 2023. Under IFRS, reported 
earnings include the mark-to-market value of 
the hedges used to risk-manage LNG 
contracts, but not of the LNG contracts 
themselves. The underlying result includes 
the mark-to-market value of the hedges but 
also recognizes changes in value of the LNG 
contracts being risk managed. The impacts of 
FVAEs relative to management’s internal 
measure of performance are provided on 
page 314 .
•Net impairment charges of $5.7 billion largely 
as a result of changes in the group’s price and 
discount rate assumptions, activity phasing 
and economic forecasts (in particular related 
to the Gelsenkirchen refinery). 
•In addition, $1.3 billion net impairment 
charges were reported through equity-
accounted earnings (reported within the 
‘other’ category), of which $1.1 billion relates 
to our US offshore wind projects.
See Financial statements – Note 4  for more 
information on impairments, and pages 313 
and 314 for more information on adjusting 
items and FVAEs. 
Taxation
The charge for corporate income taxes was 
$5,553 million in 2024 compared with $7,869 
million in 2023. The effective tax rate (ETR) on 
the profit before taxation for the year in 2024 
was 82%, compared with 33% in 2023. The ETR 
on the profit before taxation for the year in 2024 
and in 2023 was impacted by fair value 
accounting effects and other adjusting items. 
Excluding inventory holding impacts and 
adjusting items, the underlying ETR « in 2024 
was 41% compared with 39% in 2023. The 
underlying ETR in 2024 is higher due to changes 
in the geographical mix of profits. The underlying 
ETR for 2025 is expected to be around 40% but it 
is sensitive to a range of factors, including the 
volatility of the price environment and its impact 
on the geographical mix of the group’s profits 
and losses. Underlying ETR is a non-IFRS 
measure. A reconciliation to IFRS information is 
provided on page 360 .Outlook for 2025 
2025 guidance
•bp expects reported upstream « production to 
be lower and underlying upstream 
production « to be slightly lower compared 
with 2024. Within this, bp expects underlying 
production from oil production & operations 
to be broadly flat and production from gas & 
low carbon energy to be lower.
•In its customers business, bp expects growth 
including a full year contribution from bp 
bioenergy and a higher contribution from 
TravelCenters of America in part supported by 
a partial recovery from the US freight 
recession. Earnings growth is expected to be 
supported by structural cost reduction. bp 
continues to expect fuels margins to remain 
sensitive to the cost of supply and earnings 
delivery to remain sensitive to the relative 
strength of the US dollar.
•In products, bp expects broadly flat refining 
margins relative to 2024 and stronger 
underlying performance underpinned by the 
absence of the plant-wide power outage at 
Whiting refinery, and improvement plans 
across the portfolio. bp expects similar levels 
of refinery turnaround activity, with phasing of 
turnaround activity in 2025 heavily weighted 
towards the first half, with the highest impact 
in the second quarter. 
•bp expects other businesses & corporate 
underlying annual charge to be around $1.0 
billion for 2025. The charge may vary from 
quarter to quarter.Strategic report

Operating cash flow
Operating cash flow for the year ended 
31 December 2024 was $27.3 billion, $4.7 billion 
lower than 2023. Compared with 2023, operating 
cash flows in 2024 primarily reflected lower 
profits from operations partly offset by working 
capital movements.
Movements in working capital « favourably 
impacted cash flow in the year by $4.0 billion, 
including an adverse impact from the Gulf of 
America oil spill of $1.1 billion. Other working 
capital effects were principally a decrease in 
other current assets. bp actively manages its 
working capital balances to optimize and reduce 
volatility in cash flow. 
Operating cash flow for the year ended 
31 December 2023 was $32.0 billion, $8.9 billion 
lower than 2022. Compared with 2022, operating 
cash flows in 2023 primarily reflected lower 
realizations, refining margins and oil trading 
performance and the impact of portfolio 
changes.
Movements in working capital adversely 
impacted cash flow in 2023 by $3.3 billion, 
including an adverse impact from the Gulf of 
America oil spill of $1.2 billion. Other working 
capital effects were principally a decrease in 
other current liabilities, partly offset by decreases 
in inventory and other current assets. Net cash used in investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year 
ended 31 December 2024 decreased by $1.6 
billion compared with 2023.
The decrease mainly reflected an increase in 
divestment proceeds and a net cash inflow from 
acquisitions, partly offset by an increase in 
expenditure on fixed assets.
Total capital expenditure for 2024 was $16.2 
billion (2023 $16.3 billion), of which organic 
capital expenditure « was $16.1 billion (2023 
$15.0 billion). Inorganic capital expenditure for 
2024 includes the cash acquired net of 
acquisition payments on completion of the bp 
Bunge Bioenergia and Lightsource bp 
acquisitions. Inorganic capital expenditure for 
2023 includes $1.1 billion, net of adjustments, in 
respect of the TravelCenters of America 
acquisition. Sources of funding are fungible, but 
the majority of the group’s funding requirements 
for new investment comes from cash generated 
by existing operations. bp expects capital 
expenditure of around $15 billion in 2025 and a 
range of $13-15 billion per annum from 2026 to 
2027.
Total divestment and other proceeds for 2024 
amounted to $4.2 billion, including $0.9 billion 
from the sale of receivables and $0.7 billion cash 
received, both relating to prior divestments, and 
$0.6 billion relating to the formation of Arcius 
Energy. Other proceeds for 2024 consist of $0.8 
billion of proceeds from the sale of a non-
controlling interest in the subsidiary that holds 
our 20% share in Trans Adriatic Pipeline AG 
(TAP) and $0.5 billion of proceeds from the sale 
of a 49% interest in a controlled affiliate holding 
certain midstream assets offshore US.Total divestment and other proceeds for 2023 
amounted to $1.8 billion, including $0.5 billion 
relating to the sale of the upstream business in 
Algeria and $0.3 billion relating to the disposal of 
bp’s interest in the bp-Husky Toledo refinery. 
Other proceeds for 2023 consist of $0.5 billion of 
proceeds from the sale of a 49% interest in a 
controlled affiliate holding certain midstream 
assets onshore US. 
As at 31 December 2024, $22.0 billion of 
proceeds were received against our target of $25 
billion of divestment and other proceeds between 
the second half of 2020 and 2025. bp expects 
divestment and other proceeds to be around $3 
billion in 2025.
Net cash provided by (used in) 
financing activities
Net cash used in financing activities for the year 
ended 31 December 2024 was $7.3 billion, 
compared with $13.4 billion in 2023. Compared 
with 2023, financing cash flows in 2024 primarily 
reflected higher receipts from the issue of 
perpetual hybrid bonds and higher net proceeds 
from the issuance and repayment of finance 
debt.
In 2024, 1,238 million of ordinary shares (2023 
1,263 million) were repurchased for cancellation 
for a total cost of $7.1 billion (2023 $7.9 billion), 
including transaction costs of $38 million (2023 
$43 million).
Total dividends paid to shareholders in 2024 
were 30.540 cents per share, 2.78 cents higher 
than 2023. This amounted to total dividends paid 
to shareholders of $5.0 billion in 2024 (2023 $4.8 
billion). The board decided not to offer a scrip 
dividend alternative in respect of the 2024 and 
2023 dividends.
Debt
Finance debt at the end of 2024 increased by 
$7.6 billion from the end of 2023 primarily 
reflecting net long-term debt issuances. The 
finance debt ratio at the end of 2024 increased to 
43.2% from 37.8% at the end of 2023. 
Net debt at the end of 2024 increased by $2.1 
billion from the 2023 year-end position. Gearing 
at the end of 2024 increased to 22.7% from 
19.7% at the end of 2023. The increase in net 
debt and gearing primarily reflects the net debt 
acquired from the completion of the bp Bunge 
Bioenergia and Lightsource bp transactions 
partially offset by the issuance of perpetual

Financial results
Sales and other operating revenues for 2024 are 
lower than 2023 due to materially lower trading 
results, lower gas prices and lower volumes. 
RC profit before interest and tax for 2024 was 
$3,569 million compared with $14,080 million 
for 2023.
Items which bp has classified as adjusting for 
2024 had a net adverse impact of $3,234 million 
including adverse fair value accounting effects 
(FVAEs)« of $1,550 million, relative to 
management’s view of performance, net 
impairment charges of $3,004 million, partly 
offset by a gain of $1,006 million as a result of 
remeasurement of our previously existing 
interest and related assets on the step-
acquisition of Lightsource bp (LSbp). 
After adjusting RC profit for the net impact of 
items which bp has classified as adjusting, 
underlying RC profit before interest and tax for 
2024 was $6,803 million, compared with $8,722 
million for 2023. The decrease reflects a lower 
gas marketing and trading result, lower 
realizations and lower production partly offset by 
a lower depreciation, depletion and amortization 
charge and lower exploration write-offs.Items which bp has classified as adjusting for 
2023 had a net favourable impact of $5,358 
million including favourable FVAEs of $8,859 
million, relative to management’s view of 
performance, partially offset by a net impairment 
charges.
See Financial statements – Note 4  and Note 16  
for further information on net impairment 
charges.
Operational update 
Reported production for 2024 was 888mboe/d, 
4.4% lower than the same period in 2023. 
Underlying production « for the full year was 2.8% 
lower, mainly due to base decline in Egypt, 
partially offset by major projects « ramp-up.
Renewables pipeline « at the end of the year was 
60.6GW (bp net), including 38.7GW of LSbp’s 
pipeline. The renewables pipeline showed a net 
increase of 2.3GW during the year as a result of 
the LSbp acquisition (20.5GW), offset by 
reductions as a result of high-grading and focus 
on proposed hydrogen projects and the US solar 
business.
In renewables by the end of 2024 we had 
cumulatively brought 8.2GW (bp net) developed 
renewables to FID «. Strategic progress
Gas
In Indonesia, we announced the final investment 
decision on the $7 billion Tangguh Ubadari, 
carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) 
Compression project (UCC), which has the 
potential to unlock around 3 trillion cubic feet of 
additional gas resources in Indonesia. Tangguh 
CCUS aims to be the first CCUS project 
developed at scale in Indonesia. 
In Trinidad, we have made progress on our 
growth projects and high graded our portfolio:
•In June we sanctioned the Coconut project 
and in August we agreed to partner with EOG 
Resources Trinidad Limited to develop the 
Coconut gas field.
• In July, together with our partner NGC, we 
were awarded an exploration and production 
licence by the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela for the development of the cross-
border Cocuina gas discovery.
•In December we completed the sale of four 
mature offshore gas fields and associated 
production facilities to Perenco T&T.
In Egypt, we completed the formation of a new 
joint venture, Arcius Energy (51% bp, 49% XRG). 
The JV will initially operate in Egypt, and includes 
interests assigned by bp across 
two development concessions, as well as 
exploration agreements.
In December, we completed a sale of a non-
controlling stake in bp Pipelines TAP Limited, 
the bp subsidiary that holds a 20% share in 
Trans Adriatic Pipeline AG (TAP), to Apollo-
managed funds. 
In January 2025 we announced that we have 
begun flowing gas from wells at the Greater 
Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) project off the coast of 
West Africa. Once fully commissioned, it is 
expected to produce 2.4Mtpa of LNG. 
In February 2025 we signed an agreement with 
ONGC as the technical services provider for the 
largest offshore oil field in India, which accounts 
for around 25% of the country's oil production.Gas & low carbon energy

LNG portfolio
In April bp and Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) 
announced the signing of a long-term agreement 
to supply up to 9.8Mt of LNG over 11 years on a 
delivered ex-ship (DES) basis from 2026. This 
builds on the existing long-term sale to KOGAS 
and further adds to bp’s global LNG market 
presence in key demand regions.
In July bp confirmed it would take 10% interest in 
the new ADNOC-operated LNG facility in Abu 
Dhabi (Ruwais LNG), further deepening bp’s 
longstanding partnership with ADNOC. The 
project has planned total LNG production 
capacity of 9.6mmtpa.
bp and its partners concluded the restructured 
ownership and commercial framework of 
Atlantic LNG in Trinidad and Tobago effective 1 
October, which allows for an intensified focus on 
operational efficiency and reliability and provides 
the certainty required for sanctioning the next 
wave of upstream gas projects.

page 318  for more information on oil and gas 
operations in the regions.
Low carbon energy 
In 2024 we have initiated a significant portfolio 
reset of low carbon energy businesses and we 
are making strong progress on the programmes 
that are driving focus and reducing costs.a
Hydrogen and carbon capture and storage 
In 2024 we have refocused our H2CCS business 
by reducing the number of projects from 30 to 
five to seven high-quality hydrogen/CCS projects 
this decade, four of which have taken FID 
in 2024:
•In September together with our partner 
Iberdrola, we sanctioned construction of a 
25MW green hydrogen « project at bp's 
Castellón refinery in Spain which is expected 
to be operational in the second half of 2026.
•In December financial close was reached for 
two major projects in Teesside, UK: the 
Northern Endurance Partnership (NEP) 
carbon capture and storage project and the 
Net Zero Teesside Power (NZT Power) 
project.
•We also announced in December the final 
investment decision for 100MW Lingen Green 
Hydrogen project (see case study, right). Renewables and power
Offshore wind 
We have changed our model for offshore wind – 
delivering with partners and with external 
financing that will be capital-light for bp and 
improve our equity returns.
In December we announced our agreement with 
JERA Co., Inc. to combine our global offshore 
wind businesses to form a new standalone, 
equally-owned joint venture JERA Nex bp (see 
case study, right). 
In December the Japanese government 
selected a consortium involving bp, Tokyo Gas, 
Marubeni Corporation, Kansai Electric Power 
and Marutaka Corporation to build a 450MW 
offshore wind farm. 
Onshore renewables
In October we completed the acquisition of the 
remaining 50.03% interest in LSbp, one of the 
world’s leading developers and operators of 
utility-scale solar and battery storage assets 
operators. LSbp has developed 12GW to date 
including 3GW of projects to FID in 2024. In 2024 
it also constructed over 2GW with total cost 
under budget as well as significantly developing 
battery energy storage systems capabilities and 
footprint. In February 2025 we announced our 
intention to bring a strategic partner into the 
business.
In September we announced our plans to sell our 
existing US onshore wind energy business, bp 
Wind Energy (10 operating wind assets, net total 
generating capacity 1.3GW) and aim to bring 
together the development of onshore renewable 
power projects through Lightsource bp.
Power trading 
In August we announced we have completed the 
acquisition of GETEC ENERGIE GmbH, a leading 
independent supplier of energy to commercial 
and industrial customers in Germany. This deal 
will accelerate the growth of bp’s European gas 
and power presence.Strategic report

Financial results
Sales and other operating revenues in 2024 
were lower than in 2023, mainly due to lower 
product prices.
RC loss before interest and tax for 2024 was 
$1,560 million, compared with a profit of $4,230 
million for 2023.
Items which bp has classified as adjusting for 
2024 had a net adverse impact of $4,077 million 
(including adverse fair value accounting effects 
of $81 million – relative to management’s view of 
performance), of which $1,660 million related to 
impairments of assets, which included an 
impairment of the Gelsenkirchen refinery and $1,267 million related to loss on disposal, mainly 
related to the Türkiye grounds fuels business 
disposal. See Financial statements – Note 4 for 
further information on disposals and 
impairments.
After adjusting RC loss for the net adverse 
impact of items, which bp classified as adjusting, 
underlying RC profit before interest and tax 
(underlying result) was $2,517 million, compared 
with $6,413 million for 2023. The result was 
significantly lower, primarily reflecting the impact 
of lower refining margins and a lower oil trading 
contribution. 
 Items which bp has classified as adjusting for 
2023 had a net adverse impact of $2,183 million

Scaling up biofuels
We took full ownership of bp bioenergy, one 
of Brazil’s leading biofuels-producing 
companies, in October. The acquisition 
means bp now has the capacity to produce 
around 50,000 barrels a day of ethanol 
equivalent from sugar cane through the 
business’s 11 agro-industrial units across 
five Brazilian states. 
Epic expansion
In 2024 we launched our own line of private 
label consumer-packaged products in the 
US – epic goods . Initially featuring a few 
products, the range expanded to over 50 
SKUs by the end of 2024. epic goods  is 
available in 1,500 locations across our

margins was more than offset by a significantly 
weaker European midstream performance driven 
by biofuels margins. The contribution of 
TravelCenters of America continues to be 
impacted by the US freight recession.
Products – the underlying result for 2024 was 
significantly lower than 2023. In refining, the 
result was lower, primarily due to lower realized 
refining margins and the first quarter plant-wide 
power outage at the Whiting refinery, partly offset 
by a lower impact from turnaround activity. The 
contribution from oil trading was also 
significantly lower than 2023. 
Operational update 
bp-operated refining availability « for 2024 was 
94.3%, lower compared with 96.1% in 2023, 
mainly d ue to the first quarter Whiting refinery 
power outage.

Our sustainability frame underpins the delivery of our strategy. It focuses on three areas – getting to 
net zero, improving people’s lives and caring for our planet.
In February 2025, as part of our strategy reset, we announced we would simplify the aims we have set as part of our sustainability frame to focus on the 
areas that we believe are most relevant to bp’s long-term success. We now have five aims: net zero operations «, net zero sales «, people, biodiversity and 
water. In some areas we have retired aims we had previously set; however, in many cases work continues in those areas. We provide an update on our 
actions on those aims, and our wider progress in relation to embedding sustainability, in our latest Sustainability Report bp.com/sustainability .

Net zero 
Our ambition remains to be a net zero company 
by 2050 or sooner, and to help the world get to 
net zero. 
We have retired some of our previous net zero 
aims and are focusing our aims on the two areas 
that we believe are most relevant to our long-
term success and to achieving our overall net 
zero ambition. These are: net zero operationsc 
and net zero sales. Both of these aims make 
explicit what is needed to enable their delivery – 
and the delivery of the associated interim targets 
and aims. Our future business and investment 
decisions, intended to facilitate delivery of our 
strategy and investor proposition, will also affect 
the outcomes for these aims.
We believe our net zero ambition and aims, taken 
together, are consistent with the goals of the 
Paris Agreement. By setting a path that enables us to make a 
positive contribution, working to build out and 
participate in many of the new energy value 
chains the world will need, our ambition and aims 
support the world’s progress towards the Paris 
Agreement. 
We provide updates on some retired net zero 
aims as follows: net zero production « page 39 , 
investment in transition page 39 , advocacy page 
39, incentivizing employees page 59 , and our 
participation in trade associations page 60 .
Net zero operations TCFD
Our aim is to reach net zero by 2050 or sooner 
for Scope 1 and 2 emissions within bp’s 
operational control.
Our interim target is a 20% reduction in our 
Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions by the end 
of 2025 against the 2019 baseline. Our current 
outlook for the end of 2030 is a reduction of 
around 45% against the baseline. Informed by this outlook, and the assumptions 
underpinning it, which may change over time, 
we have adjusted our previous 50% reduction 
aim for the end of 2030 to a range of 45-50%, 
against the 2019 baseline of 54.5MtCO 2e. Our 
methane intensity target remains 0.20% by the 
end of 2025.
Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
Our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 
33.6MtCO 2e – a decrease of 38% from our 2019 
baseline. The total decrease includes 18MtCO 2e 
attributable to divestments and 5.4MtCO 2e in 
emissions reductions activity. 
In 2024 our Scope 1 (direct) emissions were 
32.8MtCO 2e – an overall increase from 
31.1MtCO 2e in 2023. Of these Scope 1 
emissions, 31.4MtCO 2e were from carbon 
dioxide and 1.5MtCO 2e from methaned. The 
increase was due to project ramp-ups, 
operational growth in our low carbon businesses 
and some temporary operational changes such 
as turnaround activity and operational issues. Sustainability
38 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

These were partially offset by the delivery of 
emissions reduction projects.
In 2024 our Scope 2a (indirect) emissions, 
decreased by 0.2MtCO 2e, to 0.8MtCO 2e, 
compared with 2023. The continued use of lower 
carbon power agreements and a project at our 
Gelsenkirchen refinery to replace imported steam 
from a coal-fired power plant with steam 
produced in our own gas-fired boilers contributed 
to this decrease.
We report our Scope 1 and 2 emissions on an 
operational control and equity share basis in the 
bp ESG Datasheet 2024 . 
bp.com/ESGdata
Methane 
In 2024, we started reporting on the basis of our 
new methane measurement approach across 
our major operated upstream oil and gas assets. 
Using this approach, our methane intensity was 
0.07% in 2024 (2023 0.05%b). Methane 
emissions from our upstream « operations used 
to calculate this methane intensity were 46kt in 
2024 (31kt in 2023b). 
The higher emissions and intensity in 2024 are 
primarily from flaring due to operational issues in 
our Tangguh operations and increases as a 
result of a temporary operating mode, which 
were quantified as a result of improvements in 
our measurement methodology. Our real-time 
methane emissions data, together with our 
increased technical understanding of methane in 
flares allowed us to identify this abnormal 
situation in Tangguh, but, generally, analysis of 
our 2024 measured data shows that overall 
methane emissions from upstream operational 
flaring were lower than previously reported using 
conventional methodologies (including those 
mandated by some countries). Marketed gas 
volumes increased by 8.5% to 3,614bcf in 2024.
We continue to work to reduce operational 
methane emissions. We remain on track to 
reach zero routine flaring by 2030 in line with 
our aim under the World Bank’s Zero Routine 
Flaring Initiative.
Net zero sales TCFD
Our aim is to reduce to net zero the average 
lifecycle carbon intensity of the energy 
products«  we sell by 2050 or sooner. We are 
targeting a reduction in intensity of 5% by the end 
of 2025. Informed by our strategy reset, and a 
range of assumptions, we are aiming for an 
8-10% reduction by the end of 2030 compared to the 2019 baseline. This is an adjustment to 
our previous aim of 15-20% against the 2019 
baseline.
We have updated our net zero sales 
methodology to follow a net volume accounting 
approach, guided by Ipieca’s sectoral guidance 
(2016) for Scope 3 reporting. The approach 
focuses on identifying the point, for bp, where the 
largest amount of sold energy products is 
transferred within a given commodity’s value 
chaing. We believe this will better reflect and 
track our strategic progress over time, see  
bp.com/basisofreporting .
In 2024 the average carbon intensity of our sold 
energy products « was 79gCO 2e/MJh. This 
represents a 6% reduction from our 2019 
baseline, driven by improvements in the well to 
tank (WTT) emissions of sold products and 
changes in the sold product mix, which have 
included strategic investment activities such 
as the addition of a signification retail power 
volume as a result of the EDF Energy Services 
acquisition in 2022 in the US. 
Net zero production and 
transition investment 
We have retired our aim related to the estimated 
Scope 3 (category 11) emissions from the 
carbon in our upstream oil and gas production «. 
The estimated Scope 3 emissions from the 
carbon in our upstream oil and gas production 
were 322MtCO 2 in 2024 – an 11% reduction 
relative to our 2019 baseline and a slight 
increase from 315MtCO 2 in 2023. This increase 
was mainly associated with an increase in 
underlying production due to the ramp-up of 
major projects « and higher asset performance. 
We have retired our aim for more investment into 
the transition. In 2024 transition growth 
investment « i was $3.7 billion, compared 
with $0.6 billion in 2019 and $3.8 billion in 2023. 
It represents around 23% of total capital 
expenditure « in both 2023 and 2024, compared 
with around 3% in 2019.Our disciplined approach to capital investment 
means that individual investments will be made 
when we consider there to be a clear and 
compelling business case, in line with our 
balanced set of investment criteria, see  page 20 .
We will continue to provide guidance on a 
periodic basis about production volumes and our 
capital frame. As announced in February 2025, 
we now expect to invest between $1.5-2.0 billion 
per year through 2027j in what we now refer to 
as our transition businesses « TCFD . 
Advocacy related to net zero
While we have retired our previous advocacy aim, 
our work in 2024 focused on several themes in 
support of our net zero ambition, including 
carbon pricing, and policy frameworks that 
support growth in low carbon hydrogen, carbon 
capture and storage (CCS), renewables, 
decarbonizing transport (including EV charging) 
and bioenergy. 
We publish examples of our activity online at

Streamlined energy and carbon reporting (SECR) information
Energy efficiency measures
Operational efficiency
We take a portfolio view of our project 
improvement activities at individual sites. 
This allows us to prioritize the most effective 
projects, supporting energy efficiency, 
reduced carbon emissions, and lower costs. 
During 2024 we completed energy efficiency 
reviews in three production regions: 
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Türkiye, Trinidad and 
Tobago, and the Gulf of America, US. We 
started an energy efficiency programme in 
our refining business, and two refineries, 
Whiting, US and Rotterdam, Netherlands, have 
completed it. We expect to complete reviews 
for the remaining production regions and 
refineries in 2025. Identified opportunities will 
be advanced through our existing business 
processes and plans that support our net 
zero ambition.
In 2024, a total of 27 new emission 
reduction projects contributed to reductions 
of 0.42MtCO 2e. This is in addition to the 
172 emissions reduction projects and the 
associated reduction of 0.9MtCO 2e in 2023. 
These projects are tracked based on GHG 
reductions and include energy efficiency 
improvements.
Emission reduction projects implemented by 
our businesses in 2024, included low carbon 
energy consumption projects, which delivered 
102ktCO 2e in emissions savings. These 
reductions were primarily delivered in bpx 
energy, US and included electrification 
projects and installation of solar pumps. 
Emission savings of ~262ktCO 2e were 
achieved through energy efficiency 
improvements in production processes and 
flaring process optimization projects during 
2024. These included:
•Our Gelsenkirchen refinery replaced 
imported steam from a coal-fired power 
plant with steam produced in our own gas-
fired boilers, reducing emissions by 
19ktCO 2e.
•bpx energy’s central distribution projects, 
Karnes and Bingo, enabled 
decommissioning of legacy natural gas-
driven equipment, resulting in reduced 
flare volumes and the switch from natural 
gas to instrument air in pneumatic 
devices.
•Restoration of cooling water infrastructure 
at Cherry Point to reliably meet refinery 
needs and improve the efficiency of 
compressor operations.Other types of reduction projects delivered 
a total reduction of 56ktCO 2e, including 
the hydrocracker improvement project at 
Cherry Point, US, which saved 26ktCO 2e 
of emissions.
As part of managing energy efficiency, we 
take a portfolio-wide approach to assessing 
and prioritizing spinning reserve reduction 
opportunities. Spinning reserve involves 
running additional power generation 
machines to provide an excess of energy 
supply. This can help to protect production 
from plant vulnerabilities, including power 
generation reliability. Reducing spinning 
reserve can increase exposure to power 
fluctuations for production. We take a risk-
based approach when considering reducing 
the number of running machines. This 
allows bp to realize emissions and 
maintenance cost reductions from fewer 
running machines, while managing the 
associated production risk.
bp is involved in several external groups 
working on energy efficiency, including the Oil 
& Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), the 
International Association of Oil & Gas 
Producers (IOGP) and Energy Star. We 
continue to run an annual training course for 
new chemical engineers, which includes 
energy efficiency upskilling, and we offer GHG 
emissions and energy efficiency training for 
more experienced engineers and 
practitioners.
Reporting methodology
Our approach to reporting GHG emissions 
broadly follows the Ipieca, API, IOGP 
Petroleum Industry Guidelines and the GHG 
Protocol for Reporting GHG Emissions. We 
calculate GHG emissions based on fuel 
consumption and fuel properties for major 
sources, such as flares.
We report CO 2 and methane. We do not 
include nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, 
perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride as 
they are not material to our operations.
Energy consumption is monitored and 
reported centrally from all operated sites by 
fuel type. This includes all energy, both 
imported and self-produced, used to run our 
operations and aligned with our GHG 
reporting boundary, but excludes energy 
content of flared or vented gas. Although 
flaring and venting reflects loss of energy 
resources, it does not reflect energy use 
required for production or manufacturing 
of products.Ratio of Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions to gross production
bp reports a ratio of Scope 1 and Scope 
2 emissions to gross production, see the 
SECR table on page 40 . This covers all 
our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions on 
an operational control boundary basis 
and uses gross operated sales from our 
operated oil and gas facilities, refinery 
throughput and petrochemicals 
produced. The denominator uses output 
from production businesses, refineries 
and petrochemical facilities, which 
account for 96% of total operated 
emissions. The intensity ratio has 
remained the same as 2023.
The ratio provided in the SECR table 
uses production and throughput from 
our operated upstream, refining and 
chemicals businesses as a measure of 
output which can be consistently 
reported against. We report data on a 
consolidated basis in the Annual Report 
and Form 20-F and this differs to the 
production and throughput used for the 
ratio in the SECR table, which aligns with 
the operational control boundary basis.Strategic report

a This section provides disclosures pursuant to the FCA Listing Rule UKLR 6.6.6R(8) and in line with the Companies (Strategic Report) (Climate-related Financial Disclosure) Regulations 2022 (The UK 
CFD Regulations). In the main, we consider our TCFD disclosures achieve UK CFD compliance. Where additional information has been provided beyond our TCFD disclosures to achieve compliance 
with the CFD Regulations, this has been specifically called out.
b Our 2024 analysis used data from the WBCSD Climate Scenario Catalogue version 3.0, published on 16-05-2024 and downloaded on 13-11-2024.
c In considering the consistency of our disclosures with the TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures we have had regard to, among other things, the documents referred to in UKLR 
6.6.8G and 6.6.9G, as applicable to the financial year 2024.
d In preparing the disclosures we have referred to the TCFD implementation guidance ’Annex: Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (October 
2021)’, available from fsb-tcfd.org/publication.
e UKLR 6.6.8G and UKLR 6.6.9G.
f We interpret the term ’climate-related issues’ to relate primarily to those climate-related risks and opportunities for bp that are relevant to the delivery of long-term shareholder value in the context of 
the low carbon transition.We support the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD), established by the Financial Stability Board to improve the reporting of climate-related 
risks and opportunities.
We want to continue to work constructively with 
the IFRS Foundation’s International Sustainability 
Standards Board (ISSB) and others as they 
develop good practices and standards for 
transparent climate-related reporting. 
In 2024 we continued to engage with the World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD) in relation to its ongoing ’Climate 
Scenario Analysis Reference Approach for 
Companies in the Energy System’. Read about 
how we have used the WBCSD Scenario 
Catalogueb to inform our own scenario analysis

TCFD statement
We report in line with the FCA Listing Rule 
UKLR 6.6.6R(8), which requires us to report on 
a ‘comply or explain’ basis against the TCFD 
Recommendations and Recommended 
Disclosures in respect of the financial year 
ended 31 December 2024c.
We consider our climate-related financial 
disclosures to be consistent with all of the 
TCFD Recommendations and Recommended 
Disclosures and that they are therefore 
compliant with UKLR 6.6.6R(8). We have set 
out our disclosures against each TCFD 
Recommended Disclosure and in doing so have 
covered both the Recommended Disclosure and 
the related Recommendationd. We have made 
disclosures that take into consideration 
references made to the materiality of information 
in the Recommendations related to Strategy and 
Metrics and Targets. In determining materiality 
for these purposes, we considered whether 
particular information may have the potential to 
influence the economic decisions of our 
shareholders. We have also, where appropriate, 
considered the TCFD guidance and other 
supporting materials referred to in the UK Listing 
Rulese. In the Strategy (b) section on page 47 , we 
describe elements of our plans for the transition 
to a lower carbon economy as we execute 
our strategy.
As explained on  page 10 , we consider our 
strategy to be consistent with the goals of the 
Paris Agreement. The strategy has been developed taking into 
consideration, among other things, the bp Energy 
Outlook  2024 scenarios (described on page 7 ), 
which take account of climate commitments and 
pledges made by countries in which we operate 
alongside a range of other factors.
In preparing our disclosures we have made 
several judgements, and while we are satisfied 
that they are consistent with the TCFD 
Recommendations, Recommended Disclosures 
and reporting requirements under the UK CFD 
Regulations, we will continue to monitor 
guidance as it evolves and consider opportunities 
to enhance our disclosures.

The role of management 
The board, subject to certain conditions and 
limitations, delegates day-to-day management of 
the business of the company to the CEO. The 
CEO is responsible for proposing bp’s strategy 
and annual plan to the board for approval and 
leading the bp leadership team in delivering bp’s 
strategy and annual plan. 
Under this delegation, the CEO is responsible 
for overseeing the implementation of a 
comprehensive system of internal controls that 
are designed to, among other things (a) identify 
and manage risks that are material to bp, (b) 
protect bp’s assets, and (c) monitor the 
application of bp’s resources in a manner that 
meets external regulatory standards. Risks, for 
these purposes, include the climate-related risks 
and opportunities for bp associated with the 
issue of climate change and the transition to a 
lower carbon economy. This is set out in the CEO 
role profile at bp.com/board . 
The assessment and management of climate-
related risks and opportunities are embedded 
across bp at various levels and delegated 
authority flows down from the board through the 
CEO. See page 61  for more information on risk 
governance and oversight. 2024 activity 
Where considered appropriate, climate-related 
risks and opportunities were discussed at bp 
leadership team meetings in 2024 as part of 
regular business performance updates prepared 
for these meetings.
The bp leadership team provides oversight of 
risk, including climate-related risk, through the 
various committees described on  page 61 . They 
are informed about and monitor emerging risks 
over the short, medium and longer-term via 
emerging risk papers produced by our SVP 
treasury. Members of the leadership team 
receive information on the longer-term risks and 
opportunities associated with the energy 
transition via updates produced by our chief 
economist. These papers are shared with 
the board. SVP level and beyond 
The bp leadership team is supported by bp’s 
senior-level leadership and their respective 
teams, with dedicated business and functional 
expertise focused on climate-related risks and 
opportunities or on matters which may be 
affected by such risks and opportunities. This 
includes: health, safety, environment and carbon; 
risk; and strategy and sustainability (which 
includes our carbon ambition, policy and 
economics teams). Alignment between group, 
business and functional leaders is fostered 
through other meetings, such as the TCFD 
working group which leads the preparation of 
bp’s TCFD disclosures. 
Management consideration of climate-related risks and opportunities is organized as follows: 
Resource commitment meeting Forum for approval of investments related to existing and new lines of business above $250 million 
or $25 million for acquisitions, or which exceed the relevant EVP financial authority, and any project 
considered strategically important such as a new market entry, see page 21 .
Group sustainability committee Provides oversight, challenge and support in the implementation of bp’s sustainability frame and the 
management of potentially significant non-operational sustainability (including climate-related) risks 
and opportunities. It met four times in 2024. During 2024 the committee considered progress 
embedding sustainability, performance against targets and bp’s position on certain strategic 
sustainability issues that present risks or opportunities to delivery. This committee is chaired by the 
EVP strategy, sustainability & ventures (SS&V) and comprises members of the bp leadership team. 
The outputs from the committee are shared with the board and its committees, including the safety 
and sustainability committee, as appropriate.
Group operational risk committee Provides oversight of safety and operational risk management performance for the group, where 
appropriate. Climate-related factors may affect certain sources of safety and operational risk, such 
as severe weather events.
Group financial risk committee Monitors the effectiveness of bp’s financial reporting, systems of internal control and financial risk 
management, namely material group financial risks. Where appropriate, it considers the planned 
approach to assurance and verification of non-financial reporting ahead of updating the audit 
committee.
Acquired businesses
Integration plans are developed to transition 
acquired businesses into bp’s system of 
internal control, over an appropriate timeframe.Climate-related financial disclosures continued

Risk Management
TCFD Recommendation:
Disclose how the organization 
identifies, assesses and manages 
climate-related risks.
Recommended Disclosure:
a. Describe the organization’s 
processes for identifying and assessing 
climate-related risks.
bp’s risk management system and policy, 
described on page 61 , are designed to address 
all types of risks including our principal risks and 
uncertainties, described on page 62 .
As part of this system, our businesses and 
functions are responsible for identifying, 
assessing, managing and monitoring risks 
associated with their business or functional area. The process for identifying risks is outlined on 
page 62  and guidance to support consistency 
has been made available to our businesses to 
provide them with a climate-related framework 
and taxonomy, which they are able to use as they 
see fit in their identification and assessment 
of risk.
Where risks – including climate-related risks – 
are identified, businesses and functions are 
required to assess them, in line with our risk 
management policy. This includes an impact 
and likelihood assessment which supports the 
consideration of relative significance and 
prioritization of risk management activities.
The impact criteria outlined on page 62  include 
health and safety, environmental, financial and 
non-financial (such as regulatory impact) criteria 
and are used for assessing risks, including 
climate-related risks. This provides a consistent 
basis for assessment across bp.
For the purposes of our TCFD disclosures, we 
use the TCFD’s distinction between ‘physical’ and 
‘transition’ climate-related risks.Identification, assessment and 
management of climate-related 
opportunitiesa
As set out in our TCFD Strategy A and B 
disclosures on page 47 , we have identified 
potentially material climate-related opportunities 
and our strategy has been informed by these. 
We identify climate-related opportunities by 
considering a range of information sources, 
including the bp Energy Outlook 2024  (see  page 
7), which helps inform our core beliefs about the 
energy transition. Business opportunities 
continue to be originated across bp, and taken 
forward through bp’s investment governance 
framework, see  page 21 .
Our gas & low carbon energy business is 
accountable for the delivery of many of our low 
carbon opportunities through both organic and 
inorganic growth (see page 62 ). Our investment 
governance framework (see  page 21 ) provides 
the mechanism by which alignment of these 
opportunities with our strategy is assessed and 
decisions on which to progress are made. Strategic report

Recommended Disclosure:
b. Describe the organization’s processes 
for managing climate-related risks.
c. Describe how processes for 
identifying, assessing and managing 
climate-related risks are integrated 
into the organization’s overall Risk 
Management.
Risk Management process
Risks which may be identified include potential 
effects on operations at asset level, performance 
at business level and developments at regional 
level from extreme weather or the transition to a 
lower carbon economy.
As part of our annual process the bp leadership 
team and board review the group’s principal risks 
and uncertainties. Climate change and the 
transition to a lower carbon economy continues 
to be identified as a principal risk, see  page 63 . It 
covers various aspects of how risks associated 
with the energy transition could manifest. 
Physical risks such as extreme weather, which 
may be affected or intensified by climate change, 
are covered in our principal risks related to safety 
and operations.
Physical risk
Physical risks are typically identified at the asset 
or project level and managed depending on the 
level of risk assessed.
In the North Sea and Gulf of America, regions 
more prone to severe weather conditions, our 
offshore facilities monitor meteorological and 
oceanographic conditions through the collection 
of measurements. This data is collated and 
periodically compared against the ‘Basis of 
Design’ for the facility. If significant differences 
are observed, then this may trigger an update to 
the ‘Basis of Design’, prompting action to 
reassess risks such as structural integrity and 
station-keeping and if necessary, implement 
additional risk mitigations, for example updating 
procedures for shutting down and removing 
personnel from facilities ahead of severe weather 
events. Updates may also be made as a result of 
other new knowledge, analysis methods and data, 
including climate projections where appropriate.
Our major projects « are required to assess the 
potential impact of severe weather and projected 
climate-related physical impacts. Where relevant, 
potential changes in environmental conditions, 
such as sea level rise and ambient temperatures, 
over the expected lifetime of a project are to be 
considered as part of the design process.Building on a modelling exercise conducted in 
2022, in 2024 we implemented a screening 
approach to support identification of potential 
severe weather and physical climate-related 
hazards at operational sites. Screening was 
conducted for a number of onshore sites and, 
where potential hazards have been identified, and 
as appropriate, this enables further work to be 
carried out to assess potential risks and 
implement appropriate management measures.
For other assets, such as our retail sites «, that 
are typically not exposed to a comparable level of 
severe weather risk, climate-related risks such as 
flooding or wind damage may be managed 
where appropriate through the emergency 
response plans and business continuity plans 
which are mandated through bp-wide policies.
Additionally, at a group level we recognize risk 
associated with the potential for increased water 
scarcity due to climate change and other factors 
and the impact this could have on our operations 
and in the catchments where we operate. In 
order to understand the water-related challenges 
that we face, we review our water impacts, risks 
and opportunities at our major operating sites. 
These reviews consider the quantity and quality 
of water used as well as any regulatory 
requirements. We anticipate adopting site-level 
activities as part of our aim to reduce our net 
freshwater use in stressed catchments where we 
operate.  We anticipate adopting a focused 
freshwater management approach, addressing 
water-related business risk where it is greatest, 
and we anticipate that  our freshwater withdrawal 
in stressed catchments will be covered by 
freshwater management plans by  2028 . For 
more about water, see page 60.
Transition risk
The board appraises bp’s strategy and monitors 
bp’s management and operations to obtain 
assurance over the delivery of its strategy. This 
approach enables the effective management of 
climate-related transition risks and opportunities 
facing bp associated with the energy transition. 
For the purposes of our TCFD disclosures, we 
group transition risks identified by our 
businesses and functions into the three broad 
material climate-related transition risks to bp, see  
page 48 . However, we continue to assess and 
manage the component parts of those broad 
transition risks, including:
Policy and legal risks
Our policy team monitors policy trends and 
leads the definition of policy positions in line 
with bp’s strategy and sustainability aims. 
They work with our regional organization as 
well as corporate entities to discuss regional 
and global policy trends and support external 
positioning and interactions relating to policy 
and advocacy topics. Our group sustainability committee provides 
oversight of sustainability matters and our issues 
and advocacy meeting covers emerging 
advocacy issues.
Our legal team manages bp’s litigation, including 
climate-related litigation and advises on the 
management of associated risks. This includes 
the use of internal lawyers and, where 
appropriate, external counsel.
Market risks
In developing our business strategies, we 
consider market risks, controls and mitigations, 
including future demand in the different 
geographies in which we might operate, the 
competitive landscape and the potential value 
proposition. We manage these risks through our 
investment decisions, our hedging and 
optimization activity, and through key business 
processes, including the group investment 
assurance and approval process.
Reputational risks
Our investor relations, communications and 
external affairs teams work to mitigate 
reputation-related risks, which include the risk of 
shareholder action. Our investor relations team 
co-ordinates engagement with key investors on 
both a bilateral basis and through investor 
initiatives to support understanding of bp’s 
strategy and gain insights to inform feedback 
they provide to the group.
Our communications and external affairs teams 
manage corporate reputation through 
identification and monitoring of key issues and 
both proactive and reactive engagement with 
relevant stakeholder groups to communicate 
bp’s positions. The team also leads advocacy 
campaigns for policies that support net zero, see  
page 39 .
Technology risks
Our technology team works to both mitigate 
risks and identify opportunities associated with 
evolving and emerging technologies that play a 
role in the changing global energy system. The 
team generates technology assessments and 
disruptive technology reports for review by bp 
senior executives and the recommendations are 
overseen by the bp leadership team, through the 
Innovation Advisory Council. In appropriate cases 
this helps to underpin and appraise the business 
case for new investments, new partnerships, new 
customer offers or new business models where 
these are being driven by technology innovation.Climate-related financial disclosures continued

Strategy 
TCFD Recommendation:
Disclose the actual and potential 
impacts of climate-related risks and 
opportunities on the organization’s 
business, strategy and financial planning 
where such information is material.
Recommended Disclosure:
a. Describe the climate-related risk and 
opportunities that the organization has 
identified over the short, medium, and 
long term.
In setting and monitoring delivery of bp’s strategy, 
the board and leadership team consider climate-
related risks and opportunities across the:
•Short term  (to 2025): aligning with our near-
term business and financial planning 
timeframe.
•Medium term  (to 2030): aligning with our 
group business outlook timeframe, and 
enabling us to think beyond our short-term 
targets and adjust course if appropriate.
•Long term  (to 2050): using scenarios to help 
explore the wide range of uncertainties 
surrounding the energy transition over the 
next 25 years. For more detail on our 
approach, see  page 7 .
TCFD categorizes climate-related transition risk 
and opportunity as follows: policy and legal, 
market, reputation and technology. It also refers 
to climate-related acute and chronic physical 
risks and opportunities. Risks in each of these 
categories have been identified using a risk 
management process that our businesses and 
functions are required to follow. For more about 
how the relative significance of identified risks is 
evaluated, see Risk Management on  page 45 .
Climate-related transition risks 
and opportunities
At a group level, we have identified three broad, 
material climate-related transition risks, outlined 
on page 48 , underpinned by underlying risks that 
are assessed and managed through the risk 
process outlined . These transition risks may cut 
across our short-, medium- and long-term time 
horizons; however, we indicate below wherever 
there is a particular time horizon in which the risk 
has been considered. The transition risks are 
also global in nature, so we do not discuss 
specific geographies here, but the underlying 
risks refer to specific geographies where 
appropriatea. We also see significant potential for 
upside – or opportunity – associated with some 
of these risks. These are discussed under each risk on page 48  and in 
relation to Recommended Disclosure (b) we also 
describe the potential impacts of both the risks 
and opportunities to bp.
Climate-related physical risks
The physical risks identified primarily relate to 
severe weather and often represent potential for 
increased drivers for safety and operational risks 
to our operations, particularly process safety, 
personal safety, and environmental risks, see 
Risk factors  page 65 . In addition, we have 
identified the potential for changes in the 
availability of freshwater, including as a result of 
climate change, as a risk to some of our 
operations. Higher instances of extreme weather 
also have the potential to impact supply chains 
and critical infrastructure, such as air and sea 
ports, as well as our customers. 
We recognize that we could also face other 
forms of physical climate-related risk over the 
longer term, for example associated with 
changes in sea level rise, extreme temperatures 
and flooding, which could impact our operations. 
As these risks are primarily operational, and 
location-specific, they are not grouped in the 
same way as transition risks.
Like other businesses around the world, in the 
longer term we could face adverse market or 
value chain conditions associated with large-
scale cumulative impacts of physical climate 
change if global mitigation and adaptation 
efforts are insufficient or unsuccessful. 
Offshore facilities
In the case of our offshore facilities, climate 
change could create greater uncertainty 
around frequency and/or intensity of severe 
weather events, such as extreme waves, loop 
currents, and storms, particularly in the 
medium to long term. These factors could 
affect the future risk profile of an asset over 
its lifetime, and could also impact production 
or costs. 
Water resources
Water resources are increasingly under 
pressure from various factors, including 
climate change, and this poses a potential risk 
to some of our operations that depend on the 
availability of freshwater. Based on analysis 
using the World Resources Institute (WRI) 
Aqueduct Global Water Risk Atlas, and in 
certain cases review of site-specific local data 
sources, six of our 16 major operating sites in 
2024 were located in regions with high to 
extremely high water stress. Using WRI data, 
we have identified the potential for this risk to 
increase in the medium term. For more on 
water consumption, see page 60 .We support the goals of the Paris Agreement and 
believe that the best mitigation against these 
types of physical risk is to seek to contribute 
along with others to the success of global 
climate mitigation efforts. Our strategy seeks to 
position us to make such a positive contribution. 
We do not currently foresee any material 
opportunities arising from changes in the 
physical environment as a result of climate 
change. However, the actions we are taking to 
make our operations more resilient, for example 
through improving efficiency of our freshwater 
use, may also bring about benefits such as 
reduced costs.

bp’s plans for the energy transition
In this section we talk about some of our plans 
for the transition across bp’s business areas 
and where we do so we have identified these 
with TP.b  We describe below how we believe 
our strategy and net zero ambition are both 
good for business and support society’s drive 
towards the Paris goals.
Throughout the strategic report we set out 
bp’s strategy and plans for the energy 
transition. This includes our progress against 
2024 performance, see page 9 .
Our progress against our net zero aims are 
described on  pages 38-39.
 
TP Our strategy, together with our net zero 
ambition and aims (see  page 40 ), has been 
informed by various inputs, including the 
climate-related risks and opportunities 
associated with the energy transition 
described above; the same is true of our 
financial and business processes. We 
describe how we use scenarios to inform 
our strategy on  page 7 .Strategic report
« See glossary on page 351 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 47a Underlying risks are specific, for example, local or business-specific risks identified by specific bp entities through the risk processes described above under Risk Management.
b This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of our plans for the transition, but rather illustrative of some of the core elements of our plans.

Climate-related transition risks and opportunities
#1 
The value of our hydrocarbon 
business could be impacted 
by climate change and the 
energy transition.Changes in policy, legislation, consumer preferences or markets as a result of growing concerns about 
climate change and the energy transition could reduce demand for fossil fuels or lower their price relative 
to our financial planning assumptions, particularly in the medium to long term, negatively impacting returns 
from or the value of our hydrocarbon businesses. Changes in regulations, including carbon pricing and 
fossil fuel policies, could also impact compliance and operating costs in our oil and natural gas production 
and refining businesses.
Alternatively, demand and/or prices for oil and natural gas and refined products during the next decade could 
be higher than our financial planning assumptions under certain transition pathways, including those aligned 
with the Paris Agreement. This could strengthen returns from our hydrocarbon businesses (including securing 
higher proceeds from assets we choose to divest) which may enable us to deliver enhanced shareholder value, 
further strengthen our balance sheet and grow investment in the transition, in line with our financial frame.
#2 
Our ability to grow or deliver 
expected returns from our 
transition businesses « could be 
impacted by the energy 
transition.Several factors could restrict the growth of our transition businesses « or returns from them. These factors 
include: lack of, or insufficient development and application of, policies, regulations and frameworks that 
support low carbon businesses; insufficient consumer demand for our low carbon offering; strong 
competition in the market; or the insufficiently rapid development of supporting technologies and 
infrastructure or constraints on supply chains for low carbon energies. This could particularly impact bp 
in the short to medium term as we seek to grow our low carbon businesses but could also represent a 
longer-term risk.
Alternatively, demand, policy support or enabling technology and supply chain growth for renewables 
could support a more rapid portfolio shift with expansion of our low carbon businesses and higher returns 
from them.
Some low carbon businesses, including renewable power, bioenergy and emerging technologies such as 
hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS), rely on policy support to promote growth. We aim to 
advocate more actively for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing (see page 39 ).
Changes in customer preferences, pace of technology and infrastructure development and deployment and 
costs could impact the markets for low carbon products and services. For example, the pace of adoption of 
electric vehicles (EV) could impact utilization rates, and consequently returns, from our EV charging networks. 
We recognize that the pace of our transition relative to our core low carbon target sectors and regions is 
important. If we move more slowly than those markets, we may miss investment opportunities and customers 
may prefer different suppliers with potential negative consequences to demand for our products and to our 
reputation. If we move faster than these markets, we risk investing in technologies or low carbon products that 
are unsuccessful because there is insufficient demand for them. However, our investment may also help to 
stimulate demand and provide us with a leading position in growth markets.
#3 
Our ability to implement our 
strategy could be impacted by 
changing stakeholder attitudes 
towards the energy sector, 
climate change and the 
energy transition.Negative perceptions of the energy sector, or bp, could have a number of consequences, for example: 
adverse litigation; reputational impacts, including our ability to attract and retain talent; and shareholder 
action. These consequences could affect us in the short, medium or long term. 
Alternatively, increased support from our stakeholders could enable access to additional capital and new 
investors, strengthening our ability to deliver our strategy and enabling faster growth of our low carbon 
businesses. 
The world is in an ‘energy addition’ phase of the energy transition in which it is consuming increasing amounts 
of both low carbon energy and fossil fuels. The bp Energy Outlook 2024  (as described on page 7 ) highlights 
that, although the structure of energy demand will likely change over the long term, with the importance of 
fossil fuels declining, replaced by a growing share of low carbon energy, led by wind and solar power, oil and 
natural gas continue to play a significant role in the global energy system for the next 10-15 years. This 
requires continuing investment in upstream oil and natural gas. 
The insights from the bp Energy Outlook 2024  support our view that investment into oil and gas will be needed 
for decades to come and also that, while the pace and shape of the transition in the long run is uncertain, we 
continue to see the energy transition as a significant opportunity to grow value. 
Perceived inconsistencies between the pace of bp’s transition and societal expectations could have 
reputational and commercial impacts that might impair our ability to deliver our strategy. However, we also 
see potential to positively differentiate bp, by delivering against our strategy, net zero ambition and 
sustainability aims.Climate-related financial disclosures continued
48 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

Oil and gas
As announced in February 2025, we are 
increasing upstream investment versus our prior 
guidance. This additional investment allows us to 
strengthen the portfolio, for example the 
redevelopment of several giant oilfields in Kirkuk, 
Iraq, page 32 , underpinning expected growth in 
underlying production to 2.3-2.5mmboe/d in 
2030, excluding future potential divestments. We 
recognize that the transition presents uncertainty 
for our upstream business, including the 
possibility of lower oil and gas prices, but in 
recent years we have made strong progress 
improving operational reliability and 
commerciality across our portfolio, and we retain 
optionality to divest some lower margin barrels 
by 2030. We intend to maintain the disciplined 
application of our balanced investment criteria, 
which include the consideration of hurdle rates of 
15% from a balanced portfolio across oil and 
gas. Read more about our investment process 
on page 20 .
As an outcome of our strategy and informed by 
our current outlook, and its underlying 
assumptions, which may change over time, we 
are aiming for the Scope 1 and 2 emissions from 
our operations – the majority of which are 
associated with the operating assets in our 
hydrocarbons portfolio (refining and upstream 
oil and gas combined) – to be 45-50% lower at 
the end of 2030 than in 2019 and we plan to 
maintain ‘near zero’ methane intensity « across 
our operated producing assets, see pages 38-39 . 
TP Customers and products 
As announced in February 2025, we are focusing 
the downstream – our customer and products 
business – reshaping the portfolio to focus on 
markets and businesses where we have 
advantaged and integrated positions. 
We recognize the risk of a decline in demand for 
conventional vehicle fuels and products due to 
the energy transition and are working to increase 
the efficiency and resilience of our existing fuels 
and lubricants businesses through operating 
cost reductions and margin optimization. We are 
also increasing the resilience of our existing fuels 
network, high-grading our regional footprint and 
reallocating capital into our most advantaged 
positions on major transit routes where we see 
sustained demand for fuels and EV growth. Since 
2020 we have announced our exit from two retail 
markets, and the sale of another. Our integrated 
mobility model across fuels (hydrocarbons and 
biofuels), convenience and EV charging provides 
resilience to the pace of transition by allowing us 
to flex our offer to meet customer demand.
We are also leveraging our brand in the fast-
growing synthetics segment and building 
exposure to the growing industrial segment. In 
Aviation, we will make selected high-return 
investments to build our footprint; and see strong 
growth potential in sustainable aviation fuel 
through the transition.Our biofuels business is already playing a key 
role in building resilience to the energy transition 
– helping to decarbonize the mobility value chain 
using existing infrastructure. We recently took 
full ownership of bp bioenergy in Brazil, 
accessing around 50kb/d of production and see 
potential for future growth with support from 
policy and market conditions. Our feedstock 
positions (such as our strategic collaboration 
with Corteva aimed at producing and delivering 
crop-based biofuel feedstocks) also provide 
additional resilience and opportunity to 
anticipated supply shortages in the transition, 
see page 35 .
At our refineries, the energy transition could 
impact demand for certain products in the future, 
potentially leading to lower margins and requiring 
less efficient refineries to be retired. 
Consequently, we are continuing to drive greater 
competitiveness and value from our refineries, 
aiming for 96% or above Solomon refining 
availability. We are also repositioning our refining 
portfolio (see our announced plans to market the 
Gelsenkirchen complex for example ( page  35)) 
and building resilience through value chain 
integration (US, Spain) and future biofuels. 
TP Low carbon energy
Recent volatility and uncertainty has impacted 
low carbon energy businesses globally, 
demonstrating the need to be aligned with and 
flexible to market and policy development. As 
announced in February 2025, we are changing 
our model for low carbon – delivering with 
partners and with external financing that will be 
capital-light for bp and help improve our equity 
returns. In renewable power we now have the 
Lightsource bp platform, and have announced an 
agreement to form another – JERA Nex bp. 
Recognizing the exposure to transition volatility 
seen in recent years, JERA Nex bp plans to focus 
on highly disciplined, capital efficient growth. We 
will also maintain access to our equity share of 
power offtake to support our own growing 
internal demand. Lightsource bp is now scaled to 
deliver 3-5GW annually, backed by around 50GW 
mature pipeline with further potential to scale 
while remaining capital-light for bp. 
In our hydrogen and CCS businesses, we are 
prioritizing fewer, higher value projects in the 
near term while building capability and future 
optionality to scale and grow as the market 
develops. By focusing on projects in jurisdictions 
where we have an adequate regulatory 
framework, access to the value chain including 
our own or customer demand and leveraging 
access to advantaged carbon capture and 
renewable power, we aim, over time, to 
decarbonize our operations and help our 
customers decarbonize. We sanctioned four 
projects, for example, Lingen, Germany in 2024 
(see page 23 ) and have a strong pipeline with 
which to respond to future demand growth.TP Supply, trading and shipping (ST&S)
Our ST&S business provides risk management, 
flow and optimization services to our bp equity 
and assets, with a proven track record of 
resilience to commodity cycles and the ability to 
capture upside when market conditions present 
greater opportunities. 
Our diversified oil business helps mitigate the 
risk of falling demand in the US and Europe by 
providing access to growing demand centres 
such as Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa 
and in growth markets such as petrochemicals, 
while our LNG portfolio offers flexibility through 
our advantaged key global positions. 
Together with traditional hydrocarbons, we are 
positioned to access growth markets, creating 
diversification and greater resilience across 
power, biogas, biofuels and adjacent agriculture 
commodities. Our power trading business allows 
us to optimize across the value chain from 
generation across grid markets to customers. 
This helps position us for further electrification of 
the energy system as well as further 
decarbonization of electricity. 
Through Archaea, we believe we are uniquely 
positioned in the US to meet growing demand for 
biogas as the transition progresses. Our 
business is integrated across the value chain, 
enabling us to capture rent as the market 
evolves. We are building resilience by improving 
capital efficiency and reducing operating costs 
and continue to assess and develop new routes 
to market and customer solutions to create 
future optionality.
Impact on technology
We are investing in digital and technology 
solutions that can help to generate value for bp, 
manage risk and help accelerate the transition 
through focused scale-up and innovation. This 
investment includes targeted focus on research 
and development where bp is and can be 
differentiated and growing partnerships to 
increase leverage. We expect our research and 
development spend to be increasingly focused 
on technologies with the potential to help identify 
and access new oil and gas opportunities at 
lower cost, reduce GHG emissions and enable 
our low carbon energy businesses. See page 36  
for examples of technology investments in 2024.
We recognize the potential for disruptive 
technologies to impact our strategy. Alongside 
our research and development investments, our 
bp ventures portfolio also includes investments 
in emerging technologies and business models 
that may help enable the transition to a low 
carbon economy, including increasing focus on 
oil and gas technologies. Strategic report

Physical risk
The potential impacts of the types of physical 
risks we have identified could include reduced 
production, throughput or sales – for example as 
a result of damage to facilities or supply chain 
disruption – or in a most extreme case loss of 
life or an asset. Due to uncertainties associated 
with the impact of climate change on severe 
weather events in the future, it is difficult to 
quantify the potential impacts associated with 
any increase in these risks as a result of 
climate change.
Having considered both geographic factors and 
the ability of climate models to adequately 
represent future trends in physical climate 
parameters, we seek to take the uncertainties 
concerning climate-related physical risk into 
account in our approach to design and operating 
criteria for existing assets and new major 
projects«. Where appropriate, we have updated 
our metocean design criteria to include 
consideration of both forward-looking and 
historic models, including climate and synthetic 
models, in an attempt to mitigate both models 
and extrapolation uncertainty. The particular 
models chosen will depend in part on geographic 
location. See Risk Management,  page 45 for how 
we manage these uncertainties.
As a step in seeking to improve the resilience of 
our operations to the physical changes that 
might result from climate change that we have 
described above, we have undertaken screening 
of present-day and future potential physical risk 
exposure for selected key assets and identified 
those sites with potential for heightened 
exposure to physical risks in order to prioritize 
these for further site-based assessment.
Recognizing the potential impact of climate 
change and other factors on water resources, as 
part of our water aim (see page 60 ), we are 
taking steps to be more efficient in operational 
freshwater use (read more about water use on  
page 60 ). 
Impacts on our financial planning 
Capital allocation:  We plan to invest sufficient 
capital to execute our strategy, enabling us to 
mitigate the risks and capture the opportunities 
we have identified. As part of our annual planning 
processes, we assess the distribution of capital 
across our business areas, including 
consideration of market evolution. In February 
2025 we announced that we expect capital 
expenditure to be around $15 billion in 2025; and 
in a range of $13-15 billion through 2026 to 2027. 
To help maintain resilience to the pace of 
transition and access opportunities, we will 
continue to flex capital as policies, technologies 
and markets evolve.Access to capital: While there is potential for 
concerns about the energy transition to impact 
banks’ or debt investors’ appetite to finance 
hydrocarbon activity, we do not anticipate any 
material change to funding in the short to 
medium term. We are committed to 
strengthening our balance sheet, introducing a 
net debt target of $14-18 billiona by the end of 
2027 to further improve credit metrics within the 
‘A’ range. In 2022 we reduced our net debt by 
over $9 billion and by a further $0.5 billion in 
2023. In 2024 net debt increased from 
$20.9 billion to $23.0 billion, reflecting acquired 
debt from the bp Bunge Bioenergia and 
Lightsource bp transactions. Since the end of 
2019 we have repurchased around $24 billion of 
short-dated existing bonds and issued over $12 
billion of new bonds with a duration of 20 years 
or longer, doubling the duration of our debt book. 
Additionally, we have continued to have good 
access to the commercial paper markets. We 
provide more detail on financial risk factors, 
including liquidity risk in Financial statements – 
Note 29 .
Investment criteria:  Investments are evaluated 
against a balanced set of investment criteria - for 
example assessment of economics includes a 
set of price assumptions that reflect our view of 
market evolution (for our key investment 
appraisal price assumptions, see page 20 ). In 
addition, the investment economics for all 
investment cases where bp’s share of annual 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 
operations are anticipated to exceed specific 
thresholds include a carbon price for those 
emissions, that rises from 2025 levels to $135/
teCO 2e (2023 $ real) in 2030. 
When taking investment decisions we continue 
to consider six balanced investment criteria – 
including sustainability (see  page 22 ).
Impacts on financial performance 
and position
Assessing the impact of climate change and the 
energy transition requires the use of a number of 
judgements and estimates. We have set out the 
significant accounting policies, judgements and 
estimates used in assessing the impact of 
climate change in Financial statements –  Note 1 . 
This includes information on pricing, useful 
economic lives, timing of implementation of 
policies or decommissioning provisions, and 
assumptions related to how each might change 
over time and how such assumptions may 
impact our currently reported assets 
and liabilities.Our price assumptions, including those set out 
on page 20 , reflect a range of future possible 
scenarios and take account of the potential 
impact of climate-related risks and opportunities 
as well as current economic and geopolitical 
factors. Consequently, impairment losses and 
impairment reversals consider inputs that arise 
from climate change and the energy transition. It 
is not possible to quantify separately the impact 
of these different inputs on our impairments. 
However, in conducting our impairment 
sensitivity tests, that in part reflect transition 
downside risk, we consider reductions in revenue 
that, if driven by price alone, would be consistent 
with prices within the range covered by the 1.5°C 
scenario family within the WBCSD data sets used 
for TCFD resilience testing below. 
Financial statements –  Note 1  provides 
information on impairment assumptions and 
sensitivities. Note 4  provides information on 
gains and losses on disposal or closure of 
business and operations, and impairments and 
impairment reversals, and  Note 8 provides 
information on impairment losses relating to 
exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural 
gas resources. See Financial statements –  Note 
1, Note 4  and Note 8  for more information.

c. Describe the resilience of the 
organization’s strategy, taking into 
consideration different climate-related 
scenarios, including a 2°C or lower 
scenario.
We believe our strategy positions bp for success 
and resilience in a Paris-consistent world – a 
world that is progressing on one of the many 
global trajectories considered to be Paris-
consistent, and ultimately meets the Paris goals, 
see pages 10-11 . 
As in 2023, to help test our view of this, we have 
assessed the resilience of our strategy to 
different climate-related scenarios, including 
1.5°C consistent scenarios. We did this in 
three steps:
1. First, we evaluated all business areas in our 
portfolio by i) quantitatively assessing their 
financial significance, in the context of bp’s 
total financial outlook, to understand the 
potential scale of financial/strategic impact 
that could be put at risk if exposed to 
transition uncertainty, including 1.5°C; and ii) 
considering whether there is a key variable – 
such as price, margin or demand – which 
would represent a principal transition driver 
of such risk. Climate-related financial disclosures continued
50 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024a  Potential proceeds from any transactions related to Castrol  strategic review and announcement to bring a strategic partner into Lightsource bp will be allocated to reduce net debt.

2. Second, we quantitatively assessed the 
impact, to each business area, of potential 
transition exposure scenarios in 2030 – the 
point in our planning horizon at which there is 
widest transition uncertainty. 
– For each of those business areas with 
both sufficient scale and for which a 
specific transition risk driver was identified 
– which collectively represent over 80% of 
our 2030 adjusted EBITDA « outlook – we 
performed a scenario analysis focused on 
that transition risk driver, across a range of 
transition pathwaysa, including 1.5°C, as 
set out below and in our methodology 
summary on page 53 . 
– For each of the remaining business areas 
we performed a simplified quantitative 
scenario analysis, by testing the financial 
impact of a scenario in which each 
business area’s expected 2030 adjusted 
EBITDA is assumed to be reduced to zero 
– an outcome at least as detrimental to 
that business area’s adjusted EBITDA as 
could reasonably be expected to result 
from business-as-usual (BAU), well-
below-2°C and 1.5°C transition pathways.
In this way, all business areas were 
quantitatively tested at, or beyond, a range of 
transition scenarios.
3. Finally, on the basis of the results of steps 1 
and 2, we identified those business areas for 
which the possible consequences of the 
downside scenario(s) were sufficiently 
significant to potentially jeopardize group 
strategic resilience – the only business areas 
for which this was found to be the case were 
oil and gas production with respect to their 
exposure to oil price. For these business 
areas we assessed the potential implications 
for bp’s strategic resilience (as defined below) 
over the full period from 2026 to 2030. 
To undertake steps 2 and 3, we identified 
financial criteria which can be modelled as 
proxies for strategic resilience – choosing to do 
this through three lenses consistent with our 
financial frame (as set out on page 18), being our 
ability to deliver:
i. a stronger balance sheet that improves our 
credit metrics within the ‘A’ grade range; 
ii. resilient dividend and sharing of excess cash 
with shareholders through buybacks over 
time; and 
iii. disciplined investment allocations within our 
capital frame .This is not intended to represent a ‘definition’ of 
resilience beyond the purposes of this exercise, 
and a core assumption of this analysis is 
necessarily that, aside from any implications of 
the scenarios being tested, including potential 
controllable mitigations such as capital or cost 
management that we might naturally expect to 
take in response, bp will deliver the assumed 
underlying strategic and financial priorities out 
to 2030. 
Our approach, described in more detail on 
page 53 , is directly applicable to transition risks 
#1 and #2 – as well as their associated 
opportunities – as these lend themselves to a 
financially quantified scenario-based analysis. 
The approach does not directly address 
transition risk #3 – however, we believe that 
some of the potential drivers for transition risk 
#3, namely policy and societal trends, may be 
implicit in these scenarios, and we believe that 
the successful execution of our strategy will, over 
time, help to mitigate this risk to bp as well as 
positioning us to take advantage of the potential 
associated opportunities. This scenario analysis 
exercise also does not directly address climate-
related physical risk, our strategic resilience to 
which is further discussed below. 
Key insights from our scenario analysis 
and resilience test
While the results of any such analysis must be 
treated with caution – each is necessarily 
dependent on numerous assumptions and 
methodological choices, and each has its own 
limitations – overall, this analysis and resilience 
test reinforced our confidence in the continued 
resilience of our strategy to a wide range of 
transition scenarios, including those consistent 
with limiting temperature rise to 1.5°C, and in 
particular, as our greatest transition exposure, to 
oil price scenarios, tested to 2030. 
In undertaking this analysis we observed:
•There is considerable uncertainty across, 
and often within, each WBCSD Scenario 
Catalogue family in the pace and nature of 
the transition to 2030 – and therefore 
considerable range of potential financial 
impact across some of the variables selected 
for the analysis, reflecting the complexity and 
interdependencies of the energy transition 
(see table on  page 54 ). Generally, we 
observed that the faster the pace of 
transition, the greater the uncertainty in the 
exact shape of the resulting energy system 
in 2030.•Oil price is likely to remain the main source of 
climate-related transition uncertainty for our 
strategy through to 2030, reflecting both the 
wide range of potential pathways and the 
contribution to our expected total adjusted 
EBITDA over this period, that oil-price-linked 
businesses representa. In the 1.5°C family, the 
potential downside suggested by the lowest 
oil prices is around 30% of group adjusted 
EBITDA in 2030. However, in a number of the 
scenarios based on the WBCSD Scenario 
Catalogue ranges, including those consistent 
with 1.5°C, well-below 2°C and BAU families, 
oil price could offer a financial upside relative 
to our reference 2030 group business 
outlook.
•Even with the most extreme low oil price 
environment in any of the scenarios, 
sustained over the period from 2026-30b and 
taking into account our ability to optimize 
within the frames set out in our strategy 
(above), and the spend mitigations that we 
would naturally be expected to see or to make 
in a lower oil-price world, in our analysis we 
are able to deliver across the three lenses we 
use to consider strategic resilience for TCFD 
purposes, described above. 
•The maximum potential scale of downside 
impact on our 2030 expected group adjusted 
EBITDA (across the 1.5°C, well-below 2°C and 
BAU scenarios) from our other natural gas 
businesses was around 5%, while from each 
of our conventional refining, fuels and low 
carbon activities « was modelled to be <3%.
•Our diversified portfolio helps mitigate the 
implications for our strategic resilience of the 
exposure of any one of the individual 
business areas to the identified risk. It is 
reasonable to consider each potential 
outcome in isolation since the outcomes for 
different business areas vary across 
scenarios (see table on page 54 ).
•In a BAU scenario, we believe our strategy 
mitigates the risk of what we and others have 
referred to as a ‘delayed and disorderly’ 
transition, which might follow in the medium 
to long term. Should the growth of any one of 
our in-scope transition business « areas be 
challenged by the downside range in the 
relevant variable, our analysis suggests that 
the impact of this on group adjusted EBITDA 
in 2030 would not be sufficient to impact the 
resilience of our strategy, as described 
above, in that timeframe. 
It is important to note that insights from this 
analysis are necessarily limited by the scenarios, 
methodologies and business assumptions used. 
The analysis should not be taken as a prediction 
of the future.Strategic report
« See glossary on page 351 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 51a Although such scenarios do not and cannot represent all possible futures, we value them as a simplified and schematic way to consider the potential implications of, and uncertainty inherent within, a 
range of possible energy transition pathways to a future bp portfolio mix. 
b Note that for the purposes of our scenario analysis and resilience test, we have assessed the impact of oil price across both our oil production businesses and those natural gas businesses for which 
commercial outcomes are linked to oil price.
c Our multi-year (2026-30) oil price resilience test considered sustained low oil prices consistent with the most extreme WBCSD Scenario Catalogue 2025 and 2030 scenarios – for 2025 the UN PRI 
(Inevitable Policy Response Forecast Policy Scenario) at $54/bbl, and for 2030 the UN PRI (Inevitable Policy Response Required Policy Scenario) at $34.2/bbl (both 2022 $ real, and then inflated in line 
with bp’s other planning assumptions, and intervening years interpolated between the two years).

Maintaining strategic resilience 
to the transition
Taking into consideration potential constraints 
associated with factors such as long-term capital 
investment, contractual commitments and 
organizational capabilities at any given time, bp’s 
ability to maintain strategic resilience rests, in 
part, on the governance used to keep the 
strategy under review in light of new information 
and changing circumstances. 
To enable us to understand and respond to the 
changing pace of the energy transition, we 
monitor and assess key indicators and metrics, 
such as policy development, renewables installed 
capacity, EV sales and low carbon technology 
costs. Our strategy and capital allocation, the 
associated risks, opportunities and (by 
association) their implications for our resilience 
are all reviewed by the bp leadership team and 
the board and updated as they consider 
appropriate.
Resilience to physical risk
As described on  page 50 , we have identified a 
number of physical risks which may affect our 
business and assets, the frequency or severity of 
which could be affected by climate change. 
Exposure to physical climate-related risk is highly 
dependent on geographical location and on 
factors such as asset design, and we seek to 
manage these risks accordingly. We consider 
that our approach to managing these risks, 
described in Risk Management Recommended 
Disclosure b) on  page 47 , supports our strategic 
resilience to them. 
For the purposes of this Recommended 
Disclosure, we have considered the potential for 
physical risks to bp-operated assets to increase 
as a result of climate change (namely, increases 
in the potential frequency or intensity of extreme weather events) to such an extent as to have the 
potential to impact the resilience of our strategy. 
We have undertaken analysis of potential 
changes in certain physical conditions, such as 
air temperature, precipitation, sea level rise and 
wave heights, for our onshore and offshore 
major operating sites, based on Shared 
Socioeconomic Pathwaya (SSP) emission 
scenarios 1-2.6, 2-4.5 and 5-8.5. 
Even in the highest emissions pathway 
(SSP5-8.5) the results of our analysis suggest 
that, on the basis of the 50th percentile values 
and compared to the baseline used (1991-2020), 
changes in the physical parameters considered 
are generally unlikely to be significant over the 
medium term. 
There is, however, uncertainty across different 
scenarios and wider variances were observed 
when looking at the 5th and 95th percentile 
values. Where the data do suggest greater 
potential for climate-related changes in physical 
conditions, we intend to consider whether further 
work is necessary to understand the potential for 
those changes to adversely impact our 
operations. For example, modelled changes in 
extreme precipitation by 2030 (50th percentile 
values) are less than 10% across all onshore 
major operating sites apart from Oman – where 
we have already undertaken hydrological studies 
and flood risk assessments that have supported 
the development of our operations there. 
Our transition risk scenario analysis identified 
impacts on the earnings of our oil-priced 
businesses as having the most potential to 
impact the resilience of our strategy in 2030. 
Therefore, and viewing resilience through the 
same lenses that we describe above, we have 
considered the extent to which our oil and gas 
production business would need to be impacted by evolving physical risk over the same 
timeframe for the scale of financial impact to be 
sufficient to jeopardize the resilience of our 
strategy out to 2030. 
We concluded that a significant proportion of our 
combined oil and gas portfolio would need to be 
either permanently or temporarily shut in for 
strategic resilience to be jeopardized in this way. 
Historically, severe weather risks to our operated 
assets have not occurred at a scale which could 
reduce earnings so significantly as to jeopardize 
the resilience of our strategy. As reflected in the 
latest science from the IPCC, it is in the nature 
of climate-induced severe weather events that 
their occurrence, intensity and severity are 
unpredictable and uncertain. Our own analysis 
on major operating sites, described above, is 
consistent with this IPCC view. 
Despite this uncertainty, we have found no 
definitive basis in either the IPCC report or the 
limited number of detailed studies we have 
undertaken (see page 50 ), to conclude that 
climate-change-induced increases in the 
frequency or severity of severe weather events 
would be likely to result, at any point in time out 
to 2030, in disruption and shutdowns across our 
oil and gas portfolio on a scale that would reduce 
earnings so significantly as to jeopardize the 
resilience of our strategy.
For the purposes of this Recommended 
Disclosure, the resilience of our strategy was 
considered separately for the relevant transition 
and physical risks; accordingly, we did not seek 
to take account of any interdependencies or 
cumulative effects between the two types of 
climate-related risk, and the associated potential 
financial impact.Climate-related financial disclosures continued
52 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024a SSPs have been developed by the climate change research community to describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and 
adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socioeconomic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fuelled 
development and middle-of-the-road development.

Our approach to testing resilience to transition risk
Most of our analysis focused on our 
medium-term time horizon (2030) – far 
enough ahead to provide a divergent range 
of scenarios, while not so far ahead that it is 
unrealistic to attempt to generate credible 
financial metrics for bp, or an individual 
business area within bp. For the variable(s) 
considered most significant (see below), we 
also assessed resilience over the period 
2026-30.
Our analysis sought to quantify the potential 
impact of a range of scenarios, including 
those consistent with 1.5°C, on bp’s 
currently held (at the time the analysis was 
completed) internal reference group 
business outlook to 2030. This outlook is 
used for internal corporate planning and 
holds a current deterministic view of our 
portfolio, activity set, cost and capital frame. 
The outlook used in our analysis aligned to 
the strategic direction shared at the 26 
February 2025 Capital Markets Update, and 
the financials are assessed against the 
financial priorities set out in that 
announcement.
The steps we took as part of our scenario 
analysis approach are outlined here at a 
high level.
1. Whole company assessment:  We 
defined, through quantitative analysis, 
which business areas could have both 
the financial scale and clear transition 
exposures to potentially impact bp’s 
strategic resilience.
a. We assessed the business areas in our 
portfolio by i) quantitatively evaluating 
each business area’s ‘potential 
significance’ by its expected contribution 
to bp group adjusted EBITDA « in 2030 
and therefore the quantum of financial 
impact that might be put at risk by 
transition uncertainty (including 
pathways consistent with 1.5°C); and ii) 
by identifying, for each, whether there 
were primary potential value driver(s) 
that different transition pathways might 
impact (‘transition risk driver(s)’). This 
was performed to allocate the most 
appropriate analysis technique to that 
business (see 1b and 1c).
b. Eleven business areas (see table on 
page 54 ), representing over 80% of our 
expected 2030 adjusted EBITDA, were 
identified as both providing a potentially 
significant financial contribution and 
facing primary transition risk drivers, and 
accordingly were subjected to the driver-
based scenario analysis set out in steps 
2a-2c below. 
c. The remaining business areas were 
taken forward to a simplified scenario 
analysis, per step 2d below.2. Scenario analysis:  We tested the 
financial impact of transition on all of 
bp’s business areas in 2030 through 
either specific ‘driver-based’ scenario 
modelling (that includes 1.5°C and 
current policies), or by ’simplified’ 
conservative scenario analysis, that 
modelled cases likely to be beyond 
these ranges. 
a. For the driver-based scenario analysis, 
we selected the primary transition risk 
driver(s) for each business area – the 
variable(s) from the WBCSD Scenario 
Catalogue representing what we 
consider to be the primary driver(s) of 
that business area’s exposure to the 
energy transition. For each transition risk 
driver, we extracted the full range of 
2030 outcomes within each scenario 
’family’. Given the global nature of the 
transition risks and opportunities we 
have identified, we used the ‘world’ 
values in the Catalogue except for gas 
price (see table on page 54 ).
b. By calibrating the WBCSD Scenario 
Catalogue 2030 scenarios to relevant 
business metrics underpinning our 
strategic planning (for example, oil price 
or EV demand/utilization), we modelled 
the impact of each variable, across the 
full range of scenarios and each 
scenario family, on the 2030 expected 
earnings (adjusted EBITDA) for the 
associated business area(s). For 
example, we applied an earnings rule of 
thumb deemed appropriate to the period 
in question to the deviation of oil prices 
in WBCSD versus our reference case 
price. This analysis was unmitigated 
(see ’Other key considerations’).
c. This enabled us to assess the potential 
for each scenario to materially impact 
group adjusted EBITDA in 2030 (and by 
implication associated cash flows), 
against the reference group business 
outlook. By modelling the specific 
business area within the reference group 
business outlook (described in step 1b 
above), its exposure to the most extreme 
range of the respective scenario could 
be assessed to identify which (if any) 
variables(s) and scenario(s) could have 
the potential to impact strategic 
resilience (as defined below) most 
materially, and as such, which business 
areas should be carried forward into a 
multi-year resilience assessment.
d. For the simplified scenario analysis, we 
took a simpler conservative approach, by 
evaluating whether a scenario in which 
each business area’s expected 2030 
adjusted EBITDA is assumed to be 
reduced to zero – an outcome at least  as detrimental to that business area’s 
adjusted EBITDA as could reasonably be 
expected to result from ranges 
associated with the trajectory of each of 
the 1.5°C, 2°C or BAU scenario families – 
could have the potential to impact 
strategic resilience (as defined below) 
materially.
3. Multi-year resilience test:  This step 
tested bp’s resilience to the exposure of 
any sufficiently material business areas 
to downside scenarios that may have the 
potential to jeopardize the ability to 
generate surplus cash flow « and a 
strong cash cover ratio and gearing level 
– financial metrics that were treated for 
the purposes of the analysis as 
representing financial evidence of 
delivery of bp’s strategic financial 
priorities (see below).  From step 2, in 
2024, only the exposure to oil price was 
assessed as sufficiently material in this 
sense, and hence carried forward for 
multi-year resilience analysis. Our multi-
year (2026-30) oil price resilience test 
considered sustained low oil prices 
consistent with the most extreme 
WBCSD Scenario Catalogue scenarios – 
interpolating between the minimum 
price for 2025 (the UN PRI Inevitable 
Policy Response Forecast Policy 
Scenario) at $55.0/bbl, and the minimum 
for 2030 (the UN PRI Inevitable Policy 
Response Required Policy Scenario) at 
$34.2/bbl (both 2022 $ real). Other 
scenarios, from providers such as IEA 
and NGFS, formed part of the WBCSD 
data set, but indicated higher prices than 
the UN PRI cases used.
Other key considerations
•For the purposes of steps 2 and 3, we 
considered the resilience of our strategy 
to climate-related transition risk through 
the three lenses described on page 51 . 
We defined the following as proxy 
indicators for these lenses:
– Positive group surplus cash flow, to 
demonstrate whether after funding, 
among other things, capital spend 
within our disclosed capital frame (26 
February 2025 Capital Markets 
Update) and a resilient dividend per 
ordinary share, sufficient surplus 
cash flow remains to maintain or 
reduce net debt and such that excess 
cash can be shared with investors 
through share buybacks over the 
period.
– Healthy cash cover ratio and 
gearing« as indicators of the ability 
to maintain a strong investment 
grade credit rating.Strategic report
« See glossary on page 351 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 53

•For steps 2 and 3, we made the 
simplifying assumption that, aside from 
the driver being modelled, our strategy, 
operating model, cost basis, volumes, 
margins, sales proceeds and tax rates 
would remain unchanged out to 2030a. 
•There are a range of mitigations or 
actions that we might naturally be 
expected to experience (e.g. through 
deflation) or to take in response to 
external market, price and demand 
trends, including cost reductions, 
portfolio adjustments, distributions, 
capital reallocation or capital reductions 
within the frames set out in our strategy. 
•For step 3, given we would seek to make 
use of opportunities to maintain our 
strategic flexibility in the face of the 
many uncertainties of the energy 
transition, our methodology retains the 
optionality in downside scenario 
modelling to apply some or all of 
these mitigations.•The design of a strategic resilience 
analysis involves numerous 
methodological choices and 
assumptions – any one of which could 
reasonably have been different, leading 
to different outcomes. We have found 
value in conducting this analysis; 
however, we are mindful of the 
limitations to any such exercise and the 
highly qualified nature of any 
conclusions which may be drawn from it. 
The disclosures provided here should be 
read in conjunction with the rest of our 
strategic report, where we discuss how 
we have developed, and continue to 
evolve, our approach to strategy. 
•As outlined above, we utilized our latest 
internal reference group business 
outlook as the basis against which 
resilience has been tested, as this is our 
latest deterministic view against which 
to model the transition sensitivities to 
2030 and aligns to the strategic update 
provided to investors in February 2025. 
Alongside disclosed elements such as 
the capital frame range to 2030, this 
includes shaping assumptions such as 
future distribution and net debt 
management.  •Through conducting this analysis, we do 
not intend to imply or commit to a 
specific forward trajectory of usage of 
cash, beyond any disclosed in the 
investor update in February 2025 or 
other published strategy updates. While 
we cannot disclose, for confidentiality 
reasons, the detail of the deterministic 
case, the test assesses whether the 
resilience indicators in our reference 
group business outlook are impacted by 
the transition uncertainties tested. 
Further, by the nature of the timeframes 
considered, a variety of uncertainties 
exist around this deterministic case 
(including transition risk itself). 
•Where rules of thumb have been applied, 
to convert variance in hydrocarbon price 
to variance in adjusted EBITDA, these are 
deemed appropriate to the period in 
question – i.e. they reflect the portfolio’s 
price leverage over the period to 2030. 
Due to the evolution of bp’s portfolio, 
these rules of thumb may diverge from 
any short-term rule of thumb that we 
publish.

zero production « aim (aim 2), which was aligned to category 11 of Scope 3 .

Our approach to sustainability
Our approach to sustainability is built on strong foundations that guide the way we work and support 
our net zero, people and planet aims.
Safety comes first
At bp, safety comes first. We want to improve 
our safety performance and work towards our 
goal to eliminate fatalities, life-changing injuries 
and tier 1 process safety events. 
We deeply regret the fatality and four life-
changing injuries that occurred at bp in 2024. In 
October, an employee of our recently acquired bp 
bioenergy business in Brazila was fatally injured 
during an operational activity. In May, a 
contractor in our wells business in Trinidad and 
Tobago and an employee at our TravelCenters of 
America business in the USb suffered life-
changing injuries during manual activities. In 
September, at our Thorntons  retail business in 
the US, two employees suffered life-changing 
injuries during an incident with a member of the 
public who was carrying a firearm.
We have offered our support to the employees 
and families affected. We want to learn from 
these incidents to help drive further 
improvements in safety.
Keeping people safe
We monitor and report on key workforce 
personal safety metrics in line with industry 
standards. We include both employees and 
contractors in our data.
In 2024 our recordable injury frequency (RIF) 
increased by 8.5% compared to 2023. bp 
businesses have identified underlying themes for 
these injuries and developed plans intended to 
help reduce then in the future. 
In 2024 following the roll-out of International 
Association of Oil & Gas Producers’ (IOGP) 
Life-Saving Rules to help improve safety 
performance, we started measuring their 
effectiveness in operational businesses that 
implemented them in 2023, and work continued 
to embed them in other operational businesses 
through safety inductions, team talks and control 
of work systems.
RIF key performance indicator, page 14Driving safety
Driving continues to be one of the biggest 
personal safety risks we face at bp. In 2024 five 
severe vehicle accidents occurred, a decrease 
from seven in 2023. The number of kilometres 
driven fell by 11% over the same period.

Our Operating Management Systemc
Our Operating Management System (OMS) « 
provides a single framework for delivering safe, 
reliable and compliant operations. Our OMS sets 
out the way in which our businesses within our 
operational control around the world are 
expected to understand and manage their 
environmental and social impacts, including 
requirements on engaging with stakeholders who 
may be affected by our activities.
We review and amend these requirements from 
time to time to reflect our priorities. Any 
variations in the application of our OMS, in order 
to meet local regulations or circumstances, are 
subject to a governance processc. 
Our OMS requires each of bp’s operating 
businesses to create and maintain its own OMS 
handbook, describing how it will carry out its 
local operating activities. 
We use a ‘three lines of defence’ model to 
facilitate the effective management of all types 
of risk, including safety. The nature and extent of 
first, second and third lines of defence activities 
are based on the type and level of risk.Preventing incidents
We carefully plan our operations with the aim of 
identifying potential hazards and having rigorous 
operating and maintenance practices applied by 
capable people to manage risks at every stage. 
We design our new facilities in line with process 
safety, good design and engineering principles. 
We track our process safety performance using 
industry-aligned metrics such as those found in 
the American Petroleum Institute recommended 
practice 754 and the IOGP recommended 
practice 456.
Our combined reported tier 1 and tier 2 process 
safety events « (PSEs) have generally decreased 
over the last 12 years, apart from in 2019. Our 
total reported PSEs for 2024 was 38 compared 
to 39 in 2023. Although we reported more tier 2 
PSEs,  35 compared with 30 in 2023, we reported 
our lowest number of tier 1 PSEs in 2024 as 3 
(2023 9). 
Our central health, safety, and environment 
incident investigations team investigates serious 
or complex incidents, which may include near 
misses, and we also use leading indicators, such 
as inspections and equipment tests, to monitor 
the strength of controls to prevent incidents.
In 2024 we made further progress in preventing 
and reducing oil spills. There were 96 oil spills, 
compared with 100 in 2023. Although portfolio 
changes may affect the overall baseline of our 
operations, our goal is still the elimination of 
tier 1 PSEs.

56 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024a In October 2024 bp acquired the remaining 50% of bp Bunge Bioenergia. Shortly after the acquisition was completed, an incident occurred which resulted in a fatality. At the time of publication, 
bp bioenergy safety processes were still being integrated into bp’s reporting processes, during an initial transition period for acquired businesses, and as such, this fatality is not included in reported 
fatality data for 2024.
b At the time of publication, during an initial transition period for these acquired businesses, Archaea Energy, TravelCenters of America, Lightsource bp and bp bioenergy safety reporting processes were 
still being integrated into bp’s safety reporting processes and as such, their safety performance data is not included in reported data for 2024.
c For recently acquired businesses, there is typically a transition period while bp’s operating standards, as set out in OMS, are integrated or aligned.

Emergency preparedness
The scale and geographical spread of our 
operations mean we must be prepared to 
respond to a range of possible disruptions, 
including emergency events. We maintain 
disaster recovery, crisis and business continuity 
management plans and work to build day-to-day 
response capabilities to support local 
management of incidents. We test our plans and 
preparedness through exercises that simulate 
real-life scenarios. In 2024 we conducted in the 
region of 25 exercises in countries including 
Indonesia and the US.
Security
We protect our people, assets and operations, 
and manage security through a threat-driven, 
risk-based approach. We continuously monitor 
threats from activism, civil unrest or political 
instability, terrorism, armed conflict, and criminal 
and cyber activity. Our 24-hour intelligence and 
response information centre in the UK monitors 
global security risk in real time. It helps us to 
assess the safety of our people and provide them 
with practical advice if there is an emergency.
Cyber security
The severity, sophistication and scale of cyber 
attacks continue to evolve. Increasing 
digitization, the emergence of new technology 
such as generative artificial intelligence, and 
reliance on IT systems and cloud platforms 
makes managing cyber risk a priority for many 
industries, including our own. Direct or collateral 
impact can come from a variety of cyber threat 
actors, including nation states, criminals, 
terrorists, hacktivists and insiders. As in previous 
years, we have experienced threats to the 
security of our digital systems and our barriers 
have worked well to mitigate and contain them to 
minimize any impact on our business.
We have a range of measures to manage this 
risk, including the use of cyber security policies 
and procedures, security protection tools, threat 
monitoring and event detection capabilities, and 
incident response plans. We conduct exercises 
to test our response to, and recovery from, cyber 
attacks. We collaborate closely with 
governments, law enforcement and industry 
peers to understand and respond to threats.
To encourage vigilance among our employees, 
our extensive cyber security training courses and 
awareness programmes provide regular 
education on a wide range of topics such as 
phishing and the correct classification and 
handling of our information. We also use a 
cyber barometer tool to empower individual 
risk mitigation.
How we manage risk, page 61
Additional disclosures – cyber security, 
page 336Working with contractors
Through documents that help bridge our health, 
safety and environmental policies and those of 
our contractors, we define the way our OMS co-
exists with systems used by our contractors to 
manage risk on a site. We conduct risk-based 
quality, technical, health, safety and security 
audits before awarding contracts. Once 
contractors start work, we continue to monitor 
their safety performance. Our OMS includes 
requirements and practices for working with 
contractors. Our standard model contracts 
include health, safety and security requirements. 
We expect and encourage our contractors and 
their employees to act in a way that is consistent 
with our code of conduct and take appropriate 
action if those expectations, or their contractual 
obligations are not met.
Our partners in joint arrangements
We monitor performance and how risk is 
managed in our joint arrangements «, whether 
we are the operator or not. In joint arrangements 
where we are the operator, our OMS, code of 
conduct and other policies apply.

manage the performance of these operations. 
Where we are not the operator, our OMS is 
available as a reference point for bp businesses 
when engaging with other operators and co-
venturers. We have a group framework to assess 
and manage bp’s exposure risks from our 
participation in these types of arrangements.
Where appropriate, we may seek to influence 
how risk is managed in arrangements where we 
are not the operator.

Our culture
We want to build a culture that supports all of our 
employees and promotes inclusion, wellbeing 
and development. 
Our culture frame, ‘Who we are’, defines what we 
stand for and is integrated into our code of 
conduct and our approach to diversity, equity and 
inclusion. We maintain oversight of our culture by 
measuring employee sentiment and encouraging 
employees to use our speak-up channels. Read 
more about the board’s role in overseeing bp’s 
culture on page 87 .
Developing our people
Our people are crucial to delivering our purpose 
and strategy. We invest to ensure we have the 
right people with the right skills from diverse 
backgrounds, and we provide training, 
development and competitive rewards for them. 
In 2024 bp employees collectively completed 
more than 1.2 million hours of formal learning 
(2023 1.3 million hours). This learning takes 
place within a development frame applicable 
to all employees. It covers safety, technical, 
leadership, digital and skills training relevant 
to our businesses. Our development offer 
also includes our mandatory curriculum 
focused on compliance with applicable laws 
and regulations as well as conformance with 
bp’s internal standards.
Building an inclusive culture
Part of our people aim is to foster an inclusive 
culture with an employee workforce that reflects 
the communities where we work. To deliver our 
strategy we believe we need to capitalize on the 
diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, skills and 
experiences within our workforce.
Improving representation
We make all employment decisions based on 
merit without regard to gender, race, age, 
disability, or any other protected status. 
In December 2024 five of the 10 positions in our 
leadership team were held by women. Our global 
ambition is to reach gender parity for the top 
levels of leadership (top 120 roles) by 2025 and 
parity for all executive-level employees (group 
leaders) by 2030. We also have a global ambition 
of 40% female representation for the next layer of 
senior leadership (senior-level leaders) by 2030. 
In 2024 35% of group leader roles were filled by 
women (2023 34%). We have made progress on 
our ambition to increase minority representation. 
In 2024 35% of our group leaders came from 
countries other than the UK and the US 
(2023 33%).
bp Gender and Ethnicity Pay Gap Report , 
bp.com/ukgenderpaygapIn line with UK reporting requirements, we 
disclose information against external targets on

Inclusion
To promote an inclusive culture, we support 
employee-run business resource groups (BRGs) 
in areas such as age diversity, social mobility, 
gender, ethnicity, and disability.
As well as bringing employees together, these 
groups contribute to our inclusive culture, 
provide a representative voice for employees and 
highlight and celebrate the achievements of 
different groups. Each group is sponsored by a 
member of the bp leadership team and open to 
all employees.
We aim to provide equal opportunity in 
recruitment, career development, promotion, 
training and reward for all employees – 
regardless of ethnicity, national origin, religion, 
gender, age, sexual orientation, marital status, 
disability or any other characteristic protected by 
applicable laws.
Supporting disabled employees
We continue to take steps to help improve 
the experience of the workplace for our 
neurodivergent employees and those with 
disabilities, offering:
•Inclusive recruitment training, disability and 
neurodiversity awareness sessions, as well as 
specific internships and apprenticeships.
•Access to assistive technology support (such 
as voice recognition software, screen readers 
and AI software) for all employees.
•Improved accessibility in communications, 
ensuring bp’s brand visual standards are 
more accessible.
To help meet the requirements of our employees 
we work closely with our employee-led disability, 
neurodiversity and mental wellbeing BRGs.If existing employees become disabled, our 
policy is to engage and use reasonable 
accommodations or adjustments to enable 
continued employment.
We have partnerships to help source talent, 
assist with research and training and support 
students with disabilities to build the skills they 
need to access the workplace. Our partners 
include the National Organization on Disability in 
the US, and the Business Disability Forum in the 
UK. 
Employee engagement
Our managers hold team and one-to-one 
meetings with their team members, 
complemented by formal processes through 
works councils in parts of Europe.
We regularly communicate with employees on 
factors that affect bp’s performance, and seek to 
maintain constructive relationships with labour 
unions formally representing our employees.
We monitor employee sentiment through our 
Pulse annual employee survey, which is sent to 
all eligible employees, and through our Pulse live 
survey, which is sent to a representative sample 
of employees weekly. In 2024 our overall 
engagement metric, employee engagement, 
decreased to 70%, in line with 2022 levels 
(2023 73%).
We will continue to develop engagement plans 
based on feedback from the annual and weekly 
surveys to help us deliver on safety, and meet our 
strategic objectives and our 2025 targets, 
focusing on three areas to drive improvement – 
psychological safety, competitiveness and 
understanding of our strategy and performance.

Workforce health and wellbeing
We include an employee wellbeing index in our 
Pulse annual employee survey and weekly 
Pulse live surveys. Results from 2024 showed 
that employee wellbeing increased to 73% 
(2023 72%).
We continued to take action to create 
workplaces where people can talk openly about 
mental health and get help if they need it, with 
campaigns focused on wellbeing and inclusion. 
We continued the roll-out of mental health 
training targeted at group leaders, to progress 
our 2025 aim to train 100% of leaders on key 
mental health challenges. Sustainability continued

Linking remuneration to 
sustainability TCFD
Our annual bonus for all eligible employeesa, 
including the bp leadership team, has been linked 
to a sustainability measure since 2019.
The bonus scorecard for 2025 against which our 
eligible employees are measured incentivizes 
them through three themes: safety and 
sustainability (30%, of which sustainability makes 
up 15%); operational performance (15%); and 
financial performance (55%). For 2025 our 
sustainability measure is linked to our operated 
carbon emissions. This measure covers Scope 1 
and 2 emissions reported as part of our net zero 
operations « aim (see  page 38 ).
Our 2022-24 long-term incentive plan scorecard 
also linked to our operated carbon emissions 
performance and, for group leadersb, two social 
measures were included . 
As with the bonus scorecard, for 2025-27 we use 
an absolute percentage reduction in operational 
emissions against our 2019 baseline as the basis 
for measuring progress against our net zero 
operations aim in our long-term scorecard .
Directors’ remuneration report, page 88
Share  ownership
We encourage employee share ownership and 
have a number of employee share plans in place. 
For example, we operate a ShareMatch plan, 
matching bp shares purchased by our 
employees. We also make annual share awards 
as part of our total reward package all for senior 
and mid-level employees globally, and a portion 
of our more junior professional grade employees.
Ethics and compliance
Our code of conduct
Our code sets standards and expectations 
for how we do the right thing and empowers 
our employees to speak up without fear 
of retaliation. It is the foundation of ‘Who we are’, 
our culture frame and puts safety first. Together 
with our Safety Leadership Principles and OMS «, 
our code helps us make safe and ethical 
decisions, act responsibly, comply with 
applicable laws and deliver on our sustainability 
frame.
Our code applies to all bp employees, officers 
and board membersc. Regular mandatory 
training and communications help employees 
understand how to apply our code and how to 
raise questions or concerns.
All bp employees are required to confirm annually 
that they have read and understand our code and 
complied with its principles. We expect and 
encourage all our contractors and their employees 
to act in ways that are consistent with it.Any concerns or enquiries can be raised through 
multiple speak-up channels. These include line 
managers, senior leadersd, and contacts in our 
people & culture, ethics & compliance or legal 
teams. We also have a confidential global 
helpline, OpenTalk. It is available for employees, 
the wider workforce, communities, business 
partners and other stakeholders and can be 
accessed all day, every day by telephone or 
internet and in 75 languages. In most locations, 
anyone has the right to contact OpenTalk 
anonymously except where this is prohibited 
by law.
Any instances where we believe individuals have 
fallen short of our expectations, set out in our 
beliefs, ‘Who we are’ and our code of conduct, 
are taken very seriously and, where appropriate, 
a formal investigation is carried out.
We may take action in response to reported 
concerns to help proactively mitigate issues 
around misconduct. We follow a defined 
disciplinary process and will issue sanctions 
where appropriate. These may include measures 
ranging from coaching or training, formal 
reprimands to dismissal. 
We received more than 2,800 concerns or 
enquiries through these channels in 2024 (2023 
2,250). In 2024 around 250 separations resulted 
from non-conformance with our code or 
unethical behavioure.
As in 2023 the most frequently raised concerns 
in 2024 related to bullying, harassment and 
discrimination, with these accounting for 
around 60% of all concerns. The second most 
common concerns related to health, safety, 
security and environment. 
bp.com/codeofconduct
Anti-bribery and corruption
We operate in parts of the world where bribery 
and corruption present a high risk, so it is 
important that we engage with our employees, 
contractors, suppliers and others to emphasize 
our commitment to ethical and compliant 
operations is unwavering. 
Our code of conduct explicitly prohibits 
engaging in bribery or corruption in any form. 
Our group-wide anti-bribery and corruption 
policies and procedures include measures and 
guidance to assess risks, understand relevant 
laws and report concerns. They apply to all 
bp-operated businesses.
We provide appropriate training including for 
those employees in locations or roles assessed 
to be at a higher risk of bribery and corruption. In 2024 around 5,900 employees completed anti-
bribery and corruption training as part of our 
ethics and compliance risk-based learning. This 
is lower than the 10,500 employees trained in 
2023, due to the rolling cadence we use to 
assign training. 
We also conduct anti-bribery compliance audits 
on selected suppliers to assess their 
conformance with our anti-bribery and corruption 
contractual requirements. We take corrective 
action with suppliers and business partners who 
fail to meet our expectations, which may include 
terminating contracts. In 2024 we issued 32 ABC 
supplier audit reports (2023 31).
Political donations and activity
We prohibit the use of bp funds or resources to 
support any political candidate or party. We 
recognize the rights of our employees to 
participate in the political process and these 
rights are governed by the applicable laws in the 
countries where we operate. Our stance on 
political activity is set out in the bp code 
of conduct.
In the US we provide administrative support for 
the bp employee political action committee 
(PAC) – a non-partisan, employee-led committee 
that encourages voluntary employee 
participation in the political process. The bp 
employee PAC is governed by a board of 
directors and administrative by-laws. All 
contributions made by the bp employee PAC are 
weighed against its criteria for candidate support 
and reviewed for legal compliance before funds 
are sent to the recipients requested by our 
employees, and are publicly reported in 
accordance with US election laws. Contributions 
made by the PAC are from employee 
contributions and not bp funds.
Tax transparency
Our code of conduct informs the responsible 
approach we take to managing taxes. We have 
adopted the B Team responsible tax principles 
and we engage in open and constructive 
dialogue with governments and tax authorities.
We comply with the tax legislation of the 
countries in which we operate and we do not 
tolerate the facilitation of tax evasion by people 
who act for or on behalf of bp.
We are committed to transparency around 
our tax principles and the taxes we pay. We 
paid $10.6 billion in corporate income and

Trade associations
Trade associations play a key role in fostering 
collaboration, sharing learning and bringing 
stakeholders together. We periodically assess 
the alignment of key associations with our 
position on climate. In 2024 we reviewed 36 of 
our most significant trade associations 
memberships. We found that 29 associations 
aligned with our climate positions, and seven 
were ‘partially aligned’. Our priority is to influence 
within trade associations, but we may publicly 
dissent or resign our membership if there is 
material misalignment on high-priority issues.

People and planet .
Improving people’s lives
We want to support employees our wider 
workforce and local communities.
People
Our aim is to support our employees and local 
communities through the energy transition by:
•Equipping employees with skills that can 
improve their access to opportunities in the 
energy transition.
•Developing targeted just transition plansa 
for select assets or regions, that help 
manage potential impacts on and 
opportunities for people as we transition.
•Fostering an inclusive culture with an 
employee workforce that reflects the 
communities where we work (read more 
on page 58 ).
We support the goals of the Paris Agreement, 
which recognize the importance of a just 
transition – one that delivers decent work, 
quality jobs and supports the livelihoods of 
local communities. We report on our work to 
equip employees with the skills they need 
through the energy transition and how we are 
helping enable a just transition in the  bp 
Sustainability Report 2024 .
Human rights
We believe everyone deserves to be treated 
with fairness, respect and dignity. We strive to 
conduct our business in a responsible way, 
respecting the human rights of our workforce 
and those living in communities potentially 
affected by our activities. We set out our commitments in our human 
rights policy and code of conduct. Our policy 
aligns with the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights. 
It is underpinned by the International Bill of 
Human Rights and the International Labour 
Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work, including its 
core conventions. 
To support our teams, we provide human rights 
training and other awareness-raising activities. In 
2024 this included training for our procurement 
teams to identify suppliers in high-risk goods and 
high-risk services categories.

Caring for the planet
We want to make a positive difference to the 
environment in which we operate .
Biodiversity
We understand international concern regarding 
the global decline in biodiversity and recognize 
that our businesses can have impacts and 
dependencies on nature.
We aim to support biodiversity where we 
operateb, by: 
•Aiming to achieve a net positive impact (NPI) 
on all new in-scopec projects. 
•Implementing biodiversity enhancement 
plans at our major operating sites.
•Collaborating with others to support selected 
biodiversity restoration projects.
Building on the work we did in 2022 to finalize 
our NPI methodology for use on new, in-scope 
projects, we have made consistent progress over 
the past few years in our work to apply it. By the 
end of 2024 seven of our projects were 
developing NPI plans.
bp.com/biodiversity
Water
We aim to reduce our net freshwater use in 
stressed catchments where we operateb, by:
•Being more efficient with freshwater use in 
our operations.
•Collaborating with others to replenish 
freshwater in stressedd catchments.We anticipate that by 2028, our freshwater 
withdrawal in stressed catchments will be 
covered by freshwater management plans.
To understand our water-related challenges, we 
review water impacts, risks and opportunities at 
our operating sites. These reviews consider the 
quantity and quality of water used as well as any 
applicable regulatory requirements.
Our water consumption in 2024
We saw a 15% fall in freshwater withdrawals 
(excluding once through cooling water)e 
and a 17% fall in freshwater consumption, 
compared with our 2020 baselinef. Reductions in 
2024 were achieved through the use of non-
freshwater sources in bpx energy Eagle Ford, US.
At our major operating sites, 11% (2023 73%) of 
our total freshwater withdrawals and 20% (2023 
36%) of freshwater consumption were from 
regions with high or extremely high water stress 
in 2024. This is significantly lower than 2023 due 
to two changes. One refinery is in a region of 
medium-high water stress and therefore no 
longer reaches the threshold. Separately, we 
reviewed the status of two other refineries using 
site-specific local data sources in 2024, this 
resulted in one of those refineries being 
reclassified as not being in an area of high water 
stress, the other reviewed refinery remained in an 
area of high water stress. 
Air emissions
We monitor our air emissions – sulphur oxides, 
nitrogen oxides and non-methane hydrocarbons 
– and, where possible, put measures in place to 
reduce the potential impact of our operational 
activities on local communities and the 
environment. In 2024 our total air emissions 
were 9% lower compared to 2023.

c New bp-operated in-scope projects where planned activities have the potential for significant direct impacts on biodiversity are required to develop NPI action plans for those activities.
d The threshold bp is now using for stress is based on a water stress level of ‘high’ or above, as defined by the WRI Aqueduct Water Atlas. bp determines areas of water stress using either the WRI Aqueduct 
Water Atlas or using site-specific local data sources .
e Following an update in 2024 to the basis for calculating freshwater withdrawal to align with the basis for calculating freshwater consumption and improve clarity and consistency, metrics based on 
freshwater withdrawal data have been restated for the years 2020-2023 to reflect the exclusion of once through cooling water, including the 2020 baseline.
f The restated 2020 baseline for freshwater withdrawal is 96.4 million m3 per year and for freshwater consumption is 55.9 million m3 per year.

How we manage risk
bp manages, monitors and reports on the principal risks and uncertainties we have identified that can 
impact our ability to deliver our strategy. These are described in Risk factors on page 65 .
bp’s system of internal control is a holistic set 
of internal controls that includes policies, 
processes, management systems, organizational 
structures, culture and standards of conduct 
employed to manage bp’s business and 
associated risks.
bp’s risk management system
bp’s risk management system and risk 
management policy are designed to provide a 
consistent and clear framework for managing 
and reporting risks from the group’s business 
activities and operations to management and to 
the board.The system seeks to avoid incidents and 
enhance business outcomes by allowing us to:
•Understand the risk environment, identify the 
specific risks and assess the potential 
exposure for bp.
•Determine how best to deal with these risks 
to manage overall potential exposure.
•Manage the identified risks in 
appropriate ways.
•Monitor and seek assurance over the 
effectiveness of the management of these 
risks and intervene for improvement 
where necessary.
•Report up the management chain and to the 
board on a periodic basis on how principal 
risks are being managed, monitored and 
assured, with any identified enhancements 
that are being made.Risk oversight and governance
Our key risk oversight and governance 
committees include:
Board and committees
•bp board.
•Audit committee.
•Safety and sustainability committee.
•Remuneration committee.
•People, culture and governance 
committee.
Leadership team and committees
•Leadership team meeting – for oversight 
and for strategic and commercial risks.
•Group operations risk committee – for 
health, safety, security, environment and 
operations integrity risks.
•Group financial risk committee – for 
finance, treasury, trading and cyber risks.
•Group disclosure committee – 
for financial and non-financial 
reporting risks.
•People and culture committee – for 
employee risks.
•Group ethics and compliance committee 
– for legal and regulatory compliance 
and ethics risks.
•Group sustainability committee – for 
non-operational sustainability risks.
•Resource commitment meeting – for 
investment decision risks.
•bp quarterly internal audit meeting – for 
assurance on the oversight of bp’s 
principal risks.

Day-to-day risk management
Management and employees at our facilities, 
assets, and within our businesses (including 
supply, trading and shipping) and functions seek 
to identify and manage risk, promoting safe, 
compliant and reliable operations. bp 
requirements, which take into account applicable 
laws and regulations, underpin the practical 
plans developed to help reduce risk and deliver 
safe, compliant and reliable operations as well 
as greater efficiency and sustainable 
financial results.
Business and strategic risk management
Our businesses and functions integrate risk 
management into key business processes such 
as strategy, planning, performance management, 
resource and capital allocation and project 
appraisal. They do this by using a standard 
framework for collating risk data, assessing risk 
management activities, making further 
improvements and in connection with planning 
new activities.
Oversight and governance
Throughout 2024, management, the leadership 
team, the board and relevant committees 
provided oversight of how principal risks to bp 
were identified, assessed and managed. They 
supported appropriate governance of risk 
management including having relevant policies 
in place to help manage risks.
Such oversight may include internal audit reports, 
group risk reports and reviews of the outcomes 
of business processes including strategy, 
planning and resource and capital allocation. bp’s 
group risk team analyses the group’s risk profile 
and maintains the group’s risk management 
system. bp’s internal audit team provides 
independent assurance to the chief executive 
and board as to whether the group’s system of 
internal control is adequately designed and 
operating effectively to respond appropriately 
to the risks that are significant to bp.
Risk management processes
We aim for a consistent basis of measuring 
risk to:
•Establish a common understanding of risks 
on a like-for-like basis, taking into account 
potential impact and likelihood.
•Report risks and their management to the 
appropriate levels of the organization.
•Inform prioritization of specific risk 
management activities and resource 
allocation.bp’s risk management policy sets out 
requirements for the group to follow. These 
requirements support the consideration of three 
risk types:
•Strategic and commercial.
•Safety and operational.
•Compliance and control.
Risk identification  – businesses and functions 
identify risks across the risk types. Risks are 
identified on an ongoing basis – this can be done 
using a range of approaches including 
workshops, subject-matter expertise, hazard 
identification processes and engineering 
requirements.
Risk assessment  – identified risks are 
assessed for potential impact and likelihood 
across a number of criteria, including health 
and safety, environmental, financial and non-
financial (includes reputation and regulatory 
impact levels).
This aims to provide a consistent basis for the 
evaluation of potential impact and likelihood, 
facilitating a comparison across different risks.
Risk management and monitoring  – risk 
management activities are prioritized where 
improvements are needed based on a number of 
factors, including the risk assessment, strength 
of existing risk management measures, strategy 
and plans and legal and regulatory requirements.
Risk management measures, including 
mitigations, are identified for each risk and 
monitored to the extent considered appropriate. 
To support leadership oversight of decisions 
relating to risk management, the appropriate 
organizational level (EVP, SVP, VP) are notified of 
risks and asked to endorse risk management 
plans, depending on the assessed potential 
impact and likelihood.
As part of bp’s annual planning process, the 
leadership team and the board review the group’s 
principal risks and uncertainties. These may be 
updated during the year in response to changes 
in internal and external circumstances.
There can be no certainty that our risk 
management activities will mitigate or prevent 
these, or other risks, from occurring. Further 
details of the principal risks and uncertainties 
faced are set out in Risk factors on page 65 .Our risk profile
The nature of our business operations is long 
term, resulting in many of our risks being 
enduring in nature. However, risks can develop 
and evolve over time and their potential impact 
or likelihood may vary in response to internal and 
external events. These may include emerging 
risks which are considered through existing 
processes, including emerging risk 
communications to the board, bp’s risk 
management system, bp Energy Outlook , 
bp’s technology-related news and insights 
publications, ongoing emerging technology 
scanning and group strategic reviews.
We describe above how risks are managed. 
The following section provides examples of the 
particular risk management activities for each of 
bp’s principal risks.
Strategic and commercial risks
Prices and markets
Our financial performance is impacted by 
fluctuating prices of oil, gas and refined products, 
technological change, climate policies and 
regulations, exchange rate fluctuations, and the 
general macroeconomic outlook.
Our strategy is designed to accommodate 
a range of scenarios and be resilient to the 
volatility in the energy markets. This is 
supported through a diversified portfolio, a 
strong balance sheet and operating within a 
resilient and disciplined financial frame. We 
test our investment and project development 
costs against a range of pricing and 
exchange assumptions.
Accessing and progressing hydrocarbon 
resources and low carbon opportunities
Inability to access and progress hydrocarbon 
resources and low carbon opportunities could 
adversely affect delivery of our strategy.
For hydrocarbon resources our subsurface team 
is accountable for the delivery of high-value, 
carbon-efficient resources to deliver predictable 
and reliable investments today, as well as the 
long-term renewal of our hydrocarbon resources. 
Additionally, the subsurface team partners with 
technology to prioritize development needs for 
the future. Our gas & low carbon energy business 
is accountable for the delivery of many of our low 
carbon opportunities through both organic and 
inorganic growth. This includes the development 
of wind, solar, hydrogen and carbon capture, use 
and storage businesses.How we manage risk and risk factors continued
62 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

Major project delivery
Failure to invest in the best opportunities or 
deliver major projects « successfully could 
adversely affect our financial performance.
We seek to manage the risk through our projects 
organization which exists to assess, develop and 
execute projects across bp. The organization 
contains capability which includes the centre of 
expertise for appraisal and optimization, 
expertise to manage the design and build of 
projects and integrates with our businesses and 
functions to ensure project objectives are met. 
The projects organization utilises a major 
projects common process.
Geopolitical
The diverse locations of our business activities 
and operations around the world expose us to a 
wide range of political developments and 
consequent changes to the economic and 
operating environment. Geopolitical risk is 
inherent to many regions in which we operate, 
and heightened political or social tensions or 
changes in key relationships could adversely 
affect the group.
We seek to manage this risk at multiple 
levels, through:
•Identifying macro-level geopolitical trends in 
the geopolitical advisory council.
•Providing a clear focal point for political risk 
management.
•Monitoring how geopolitical trends create risk 
at the country level through changes to our 
baseline threat assessments.
More broadly, we manage the risk on a day-to-
day basis through the development and 
maintenance of relationships with governments 
and stakeholders, and by being trusted partners 
in each country and region. In addition, we 
closely monitor events and implement risk 
mitigation plans where deemed appropriate.
Liquidity, financial capacity and financial, 
including credit, exposure
External market conditions can impact our 
financial performance. Supply and demand and 
the prices achieved for our products can be 
affected by a wide range of factors including 
political developments, interest rates, consumer 
preferences for low carbon energy, global 
economic conditions, access to capital markets 
and the influence of OPEC+.We seek to manage this risk through bp’s 
diversified portfolio, our financial frame, liquidity 
stress testing, maintaining a significant cash 
buffer, liquidity facilities, regular reviews of 
market conditions and our planning and 
investment processes.
Energy markets, page 7
Liquidity and capital resources, page 316
Liquidity, financial capacity and financial, 
including credit, exposure, page 65
Joint arrangements « and contractors
Varying levels of control over the standards, 
operations and compliance of our partners 
including non-operated joint ventures (NOJVs), 
contractors and sub-contractors could result in 
legal liability and reputational damage. 
bp’s exposure in NOJVs is primarily managed by 
the NOJV-facing business team in the business 
or entity where ownership of bp’s interest in the 
NOJV sits. 
Support, verification and assurance are provided 
by the NOJV solutions team, safety and 
operational risk assurance, ethics & compliance 
functional assurance and group internal audit to 
drive a focused, deliberate and systematic 
approach to the set-up and management of bp’s 
interests and exposure in NOJVs.
Our relationships with contractors are managed 
through the bp procurement processes with 
appropriate requirements incorporated into 
contractual arrangements.
Digital infrastructure, cyber security and 
data protection
Both targeted and indiscriminate threats to 
the security and resilience of our digital 
infrastructure and those of third parties continue 
to evolve rapidly and are increasingly prevalent 
across industries worldwide. 
We seek to manage this risk through a range of 
measures, which include alignment to the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology 
Cyber Security Framework 2.0, cyber security, 
data protection and artificial intelligence 
standards, security protection tools, ongoing 
detection and monitoring of threats and testing 
of digital response and recovery procedures. We 
collaborate with governments, law enforcement 
agencies and industry peers to understand and 
respond to new and emerging cyber threats.
We build awareness with our employees, share 
information on incidents with leadership for 
continuous learning, and conduct annual cyber 
training and regular exercises, including with the 
leadership team, to test response and recovery 
procedures. For further detail on cyber security 
disclosures see page 336 .Climate change and the transition to a 
lower carbon economy
Developments in policy, law, regulation, 
technology and markets, including societal and 
investor sentiment, related to the issue of climate 
change and the transition to a lower carbon 
economy could increase costs, reduce revenues, 
constrain our operations and affect our business 
plans and financial performance.
Risks associated with climate change and the 
transition to a lower carbon economy impact 
many elements of our strategy and, as such, 
these risks are managed through key business 
processes including setting the bp strategy and 
annual plan, capital allocation and investment 
decisions. The outputs of these key business 
processes are reviewed in line with the cadence 
of these activities. See page 48  for more 
information on how transition risks and 
opportunities are managed.
Competition
Inability to remain efficient, maintain a high-
quality portfolio of assets and innovate could 
negatively impact delivery of our strategy in a 
highly competitive market.
We seek to manage this risk through our 
strategy, sustainability and ventures function by 
providing external insights on the economic, 
energy, market and competitive environment. 
These insights are used to help define a resilient 
strategy for bp, including decisions related to 
portfolio, business development and resource 
allocation. The ventures team provides 
commercial innovation capacity that allows us 
to build new businesses.
Talent and capability
Inability to attract, develop and retain people with 
necessary skills, capabilities could negatively 
impact delivery of our strategy.
Our people, culture and communications team’s 
responsibilities include talent activity for bp 
globally, including hiring, development, 
succession planning, and embedding of bp’s 
‘Who we are’ culture frame. They help to ensure 
that the right talent and people capability are in 
place, using local market intelligence, people 
analytics and insights to underpin our strategic 
workforce planning. See page 57  for more 
information.Strategic report
« See glossary on page 351 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 63

Crisis management and business 
continuity
Failure to address an incident effectively could 
potentially disrupt our business or exacerbate the 
legal, financial or operational impacts of the 
crisis event.
Incidents that could potentially disrupt our 
business are addressed using emergency 
response and business continuity plans which 
are mandated through our policies. We use 
internationally recognized incident command 
structures, and for significant events business 
support teams and executive support teams are 
established to provide oversight and 
management. In addition, we provide a trained 
group of crisis professionals and niche expertise 
for deployment across bp through our mutual 
response team.
Insurance
Our insurance strategy could expose the group to 
material uninsured losses.
Our insurance team is accountable for aligning 
our insurance approach with bp’s strategy and 
engaging with the businesses and functions to 
determine the appropriate level of insurance. 
We retain in-house expertise and partner with 
insurance industry leaders. Our captive insurance 
companies are regulated within the jurisdictions 
in which they operate.
Safety and operational risks
Process safety, personal safety and 
environmental risks
Exposure to a wide range of health, safety and 
environmental risks could cause harm to people, 
the environment and our assets and result in 
regulatory action, legal liability, business 
interruption, increased costs, damage to our 
reputation and potentially denial of our licence 
to operate.
Our Operating Management System (OMS) « 
helps us manage these risks and drive 
performance improvements. It sets out the 
standards and requirements which govern key 
risk management activities such as inspection, 
maintenance, testing, business continuity and 
crisis response planning and competency 
development. In addition, we conduct our drilling 
activity through a wells organization in order to 
promote a consistent approach for designing, 
constructing and managing wells.Drilling and production
Challenging operational environments and other 
uncertainties could impact drilling and 
production activities.
Our production and operations business 
group brings together all our hydrocarbon 
operations and our distinctive capabilities in 
one place to safely deliver competitive returns. 
The functions, in particular wells and 
production, are accountable for safety, risk, 
quality and operational delivery. They execute 
capital and operational activity and manage 
associated expenditure.
Security
Hostile acts such as terrorism, activism, insider 
acts or piracy could harm our people and disrupt 
our operations. We monitor for emerging threats 
and vulnerabilities to manage our physical and 
information security.
Our intelligence, security and crisis management 
teams provide strategic and operational risk 
management to our businesses through a 
network of regional security managers who 
provide front-line risk management as well as 
conduct assurance activities through a team 
independent of the business.
We continue to monitor threats globally and 
maintain disaster recovery, crisis and business 
continuity management plans.
Product quality
Supplying customers with off-specification 
products could damage our reputation, lead to 
regulatory action and legal liability, and impact 
our financial performance.
bp’s product quality policy is aligned with our 
OMS and sets requirements for our business to 
meet specifications and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements.
Compliance and control risks
Ethical misconduct and legal or regulatory 
non-compliance
Ethical misconduct or breaches of applicable 
laws or regulations could damage our reputation, 
result in litigation, regulatory action and penalties, 
adversely affect results and shareholder value, 
and potentially affect our licence to operate.Our code of conduct, the foundation of ‘Who we 
are’, is applicable to all employees and central to 
managing this risk. Additionally, we have various 
group requirements and training covering areas 
such as anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money 
laundering, competition/anti-trust law, data 
privacy and international trade regulations. 
We offer an independent confidential helpline, 
OpenTalk, for employees, contractors and 
other third parties with the option to raise 
concerns anonymously.
Regulation
Changes in the law and regulation could 
increase costs, constrain our operations and 
affect our strategy, business plans and 
financial performance.
Our businesses and functions all seek to identify, 
assess and manage legal and regulatory risks 
relevant to bp’s operations, strategy, business 
plans and financial performance. To support this 
work, we seek to develop co-operative 
relationships with governmental authorities in 
line with our code of conduct, to allow 
appropriate focus on areas of potential risk or 
uncertainty, while also protecting bp’s interests 
within the law. 
Trading and treasury trading activities
In the normal course of business, we are subject 
to risks around our trading activities which could 
arise from shortcomings or failures in our 
systems, risk management methodology, internal 
control processes or employee conduct.
We have specific operating standards and 
control processes to manage these risks, 
including guidelines specific to trading, and seek 
to monitor compliance through our dedicated 
compliance teams. We also seek to maintain a 
positive and collaborative relationship with 
regulators and the industry at large.
Reporting
Failure to accurately report our data could 
lead to regulatory action, legal liability and 
reputational damage.
Our accounting reporting and control team 
provides assurance of the control environment 
and is accountable for building control and 
compliance of finance processes and 
digital systems.How we manage risk and risk factors continued
64 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

Risk factors
The risks discussed below, separately or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on the 
implementation of our strategy, business, financial performance, results of operations, cash flow, 
liquidity, prospects, shareholder value and returns and reputation.
Strategic and commercial risks
Prices and markets:  our financial performance 
is impacted by fluctuating prices of oil, gas 
and refined products, technological change, 
climate policies and regulations, exchange 
rate fluctuations, and the general 
macroeconomic outlook.
Oil, gas and product prices are subject to 
international supply and demand and margins 
can be volatile.
Political developments, fluctuations to the supply 
of either oil or natural gas or to alternative low 
carbon energy sources, technological change, 
global economic conditions, public health 
situations (including the outbreak of an epidemic 
or pandemic), the introduction of new (or 
amendment to existing) carbon costs and the 
influence of OPEC+ can impact supply and 
demand and prices for our products (including 
low carbon investments).
Decreases in the price of energy outputs we 
produce could have an adverse effect on 
revenue, margins, profitability and cash flows. 
If these reductions are significant or for a 
prolonged period, we may have to write down 
assets and reassess the viability of certain 
projects, which may impact future cash flows, 
profit, capital expenditure «, the ability to work 
within our financial frame and maintain our long-
term investment programme. Conversely, an 
increase in the prices of the energy outputs we 
produce may not improve margin performance 
as there could be increased fiscal take, cost 
inflation and more onerous terms for access to 
resources. The profitability of our refining 
activities can be volatile, with periodic oversupply 
or supply tightness in regional markets and 
fluctuations in demand. 
Exchange rate fluctuations can create currency 
exposures and impact underlying costs and 
revenues. Crude oil prices are generally set in US 
dollars, while products vary in currency. Many of 
our major project « development costs are 
denominated in local currencies, which may be 
subject to fluctuations against the US dollar.
Accessing and progressing hydrocarbon 
resources and low carbon opportunities:  
inability to access and progress hydrocarbon 
resources and low carbon opportunities could 
adversely affect delivery of our strategy.Delivery of our strategy depends partly on our 
ability to progress hydrocarbon resources from 
our existing portfolio and access new resources. 
Our ability to progress upstream « resources and 
develop technologies at a level in line with our 
strategic outlook for hydrocarbon production 
could impact our future production and financial 
performance. Furthermore, our ability to access 
low carbon opportunities and the commercial 
terms associated with those opportunities could 
impact our financial performance while moving 
at pace with society and its changing wants 
and needs.
Our strategy, page 8
Major project delivery:  failure to invest in the 
best opportunities or deliver major projects 
successfully could adversely affect our 
financial performance.
We face challenges in developing major projects, 
particularly in geographically and technically 
challenging areas. Poor investment choice, 
efficiency or delivery, inflation, supply chain, or 
operational challenges at any major project that 
underpins production or production growth, 
could adversely affect our financial performance.
Geopolitical:  exposure to a range of political 
developments and consequent changes to the 
operating and regulatory environment could 
cause business disruption.
We operate and may seek new opportunities in 
countries, regions and cities where political, 
economic and social transition may take place.
Political instability, changes to the regulatory 
environment or taxation, international trade 
disputes and barriers to free trade, international 
sanctions, expropriation or nationalization of 
property, civil strife, strikes, insurrections, acts of 
terrorism, acts of war and public health 
situations (including the outbreak of an epidemic 
or pandemic) may disrupt or curtail our 
operations, business activities or investments.
These may in turn cause production to decline, 
limit our ability to pursue new opportunities, 
affect the recoverability of our assets and our 
related earnings and cash flow or cause us to 
incur additional costs, particularly due to the 
long-term nature of many of our projects and 
significant capital expenditure required.Trade restrictions, international sanctions or any 
other actions taken by governmental authorities 
or other relevant persons have had and could 
continue to have an impact on global energy 
supply and demand, market volatility and the 
prices of oil, gas and products. 
Liquidity, financial capacity and financial, 
including credit, exposure:  failure to work within 
our financial frame could impact our ability to 
operate and result in financial loss.
Trade and other receivables, including overdue 
receivables, may not be recovered, divestments 
may not be successfully completed and a 
substantial and unexpected cash call or funding 
request could disrupt our financial frame or 
overwhelm our ability to meet our obligations.
An event such as a significant operational 
incident, legal proceedings or a geopolitical event 
in an area where we have significant activities, 
could reduce our financial liquidity and our credit 
ratings. Credit rating downgrades could 
potentially increase financing costs and limit 
access to financing or engagement in our trading 
activities on acceptable terms, which could put 
pressure on the group’s liquidity.
They could also potentially require the company 
to review the funding arrangements with the bp 
pension trustees. In the event of extended 
constraints on our ability to obtain financing, we 
could be required to reduce capital expenditure 
or increase asset disposals in order to provide 
additional liquidity.

Financial statements – Note 29
Joint arrangements « and contractors:  varying 
levels of control over the standards, operations 
and compliance of our partners, including non-
operated joint ventures (NOJVs), contractors and 
sub-contractors could result in legal liability and 
reputational damage.Strategic report
« See glossary on page 351 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 65

We conduct many of our activities through joint 
arrangements, partners or with contractors and 
sub-contractors where we may have limited 
influence and control over the performance of 
such activities.
Our partners and contractors are responsible for 
the adequacy of their resources and capabilities. 
If these are found to be lacking, there may be 
financial, reputational, operational or safety 
exposures for bp. Should an incident occur in an 
activity that bp participates in, our partners and 
contractors may be unable or unwilling to fully 
compensate us against costs we may incur on 
their behalf or on behalf of the arrangement. 
Where we do not have operational control of a 
joint arrangement or direct oversight of 
contractor activity, we may still be pursued by 
regulators or claimants, and may still be the 
focus for interest groups or media attention in 
the event of an incident.
Digital infrastructure, cyber security and data 
protection:  breach or failure of our or third 
parties’ digital infrastructure or cyber security, 
including loss or misuse of sensitive information 
could damage our operations, increase costs and 
damage our reputation.
The energy industry is subject to fast-evolving 
risks, including ransomware, from cyber threat 
actors, including nation states, criminals, 
terrorists, hacktivists and insiders. Current 
geopolitical factors have increased these risks. 
There is also growing regulation around data 
protection and data privacy, critical national 
infrastructure and the evolving opportunities and 
threats from artificial intelligence. A breach or 
failure of our or third parties’ digital infrastructure 
– including control systems – due to breaches of 
our cyber defences, or those of third parties, 
negligence, intentional misconduct or other 
reasons, could seriously disrupt our operations. 
This could result in the loss or misuse of data or 
sensitive information, including employees’ and 
customers’ personal data, injury to people, 
disruption to our business, harm to the 
environment or our assets, legal or regulatory 
breaches, legal liability and significant costs 
including fines, cost of remediation or 
reputational consequences. Furthermore, the 
rapid detection of attempts to gain unauthorized 
access to our digital infrastructure, often through 
the use of sophisticated and co-ordinated 
means, is a challenge and any delay or failure to 
detect could compound these potential harms.
Cyber security disclosures, page 336Climate change and the transition to a 
lower carbon economy:  developments in 
policy, law, regulation, technology and markets, 
including societal and investor sentiment, 
related to the issue of climate change and the 
transition to a lower carbon economy could 
increase costs, reduce revenues, constrain our 
operations and affect our business plans and 
financial performance.
Laws, regulations, policies, obligations, 
government actions, social attitudes and 
customer preferences relating to climate change 
and the transition to a lower carbon economy, 
including the pace of change to any of these 
factors, and also the pace of the transition itself, 
could have adverse impacts on our business 
including on our access to and realization of 
competitive opportunities, a decline in demand 
for, or constraints on our ability to sell certain 
products, constraints on production and supply, 
adverse litigation and regulatory or litigation 
outcomes, increased costs from compliance and 
increased provisions for environmental and legal 
liabilities.
Investor preferences and sentiment are 
influenced by environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) considerations including 
climate change and the transition to a lower 
carbon economy. Changes in those preferences 
and sentiment could affect our access to capital 
markets and our attractiveness to potential 
investors, potentially resulting in reduced access 
to financing, increased financing costs and 
impacts upon our business plans and 
financial performance.
Technological improvements or innovations that 
support the transition to a lower carbon 
economy, and customer preferences or 
regulatory incentives that alter fuel or power 
choices, could impact demand for our products 
(including low carbon energy).
Depending on the nature and speed of any such 
changes and our response, these changes could 
increase costs, reduce our profitability, reduce 
demand for certain products, limit our access to 
new opportunities, require us to write down 
certain assets or curtail or cease certain 
operations, and affect investor sentiment, our 
access to capital markets, our competitiveness 
and financial performance.
Policy, legal, regulatory, technological and market 
developments related to climate change could 
also affect future price assumptions used in the 
assessment of recoverability of asset-carrying 
values. This may affect whether there is 
continued intent to develop exploration and 
appraisal intangible assets; the timing of 
decommissioning of assets; and the useful 
economic lives of assets used for the calculation 
of depreciation and amortization.
Climate-related financial disclosures, page 
42 and Financial statements – Note 1  and 
Note 33Competition:  inability to remain efficient, 
maintain a high-quality portfolio of assets and 
innovate could negatively impact delivery of our 
strategy in a highly competitive market.
Our strategic progress and performance could 
be impeded if we are unable to control our 
development and operating costs and margins, 
if we fail to scale our businesses at pace, or to 
sustain, develop and operate a high-quality 
portfolio of assets efficiently. Furthermore, as an 
integrated energy company, we face an 
expanded and rapidly evolving range of 
competitors in the sectors in which we operate.
We could be adversely affected if competitors 
offer superior terms for access rights or licences, 
or if our innovation in areas such as new low 
carbon technologies, digital, customer offer, 
exploration, production, refining, manufacturing 
or renewable energy lags behind those of our 
competitors. Our performance could also be 
negatively impacted if we fail to protect our 
intellectual property.
Talent and capability:  inability to attract, develop 
and retain people with necessary skills, 
capabilities and behaviours could negatively 
impact delivery of our strategy.
The sectors in which we operate face increasing 
challenges to attract and retain diverse, skilled 
and capable talent. An inability to successfully 
recruit, develop and retain core skills and 
capabilities and to reskill existing talent could 
impact delivery of our strategy.
Crisis management and business continuity:  
failure to address an incident effectively could 
potentially disrupt our business.
Our reputation and business activities could be 
negatively impacted if we do not respond, or are 
perceived not to respond, in an appropriate 
manner to any major crisis.
Insurance:  our insurance strategy could expose 
the group to material uninsured losses.
bp insures in situations where this is legally and 
contractually required. Some risks are insured 
with third parties and reinsured by group 
insurance companies. Uninsured losses could 
have a material adverse effect on our financial 
position, particularly if they arise at a time when 
we are facing material costs as a result of a 
significant operational event which could put 
pressure on our liquidity and cash flows.How we manage risk and risk factors continued
66 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

Safety and operational risks
Process safety, personal safety, and 
environmental risks:  exposure to a wide range 
of health, safety and environmental risks could 
cause harm to people, the environment and our 
assets and result in regulatory action, legal 
liability, business interruption, increased costs, 
damage to our reputation and potentially denial 
of our licence to operate.
Technical integrity failure, natural disasters, 
extreme weather or a change in its frequency or 
severity, human error and other adverse events 
or conditions, including breach of digital security, 
could lead to loss of containment of hazardous 
materials, including hydrocarbons «. This could 
also lead to fires, explosions or other personal 
and process safety incidents when drilling wells, 
constructing and operating facilities; in addition 
to activities associated with transportation by 
road, sea or pipeline. There can be no certainty 
that our OMS or other policies and procedures 
will adequately identify all process safety, 
personal safety and environmental risks or that 
all our operating activities, including acquired 
businesses, will be conducted in conformance 
with these systems.
Safety, page 56
Such events or conditions or inability to provide 
safe environments for our workforce and the 
public while at our facilities, premises or during 
transportation, could lead to injuries, loss of life 
or environmental damage. As a result, we could 
face regulatory action and legal liability, including 
penalties and remediation obligations, increased 
costs and potentially denial of our licence to 
operate. Our activities are sometimes conducted 
in hazardous, remote or environmentally 
sensitive locations, where the consequences of 
such events or conditions could be greater than 
in other locations.
Drilling and production:  challenging operational 
environments and other uncertainties could 
impact drilling and production activities.
Our activities require high levels of investment 
and are sometimes conducted in challenging 
environments such as those prone to natural 
disasters and extreme weather, which heightens 
the risks of technical integrity failure. The 
physical characteristics of an oil or natural gas 
field, and cost of drilling, completing or operating 
wells are often uncertain. We may be required to 
curtail, delay or cancel drilling operations or stop 
production because of a variety of factors, 
including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure 
or irregularities in geological formations, 
equipment failures or accidents, adverse 
weather conditions and compliance with 
governmental requirements.Security:  hostile acts against our employees and 
activities could cause harm to people and disrupt 
our operations.
Acts of terrorism, piracy, sabotage, activism and 
similar activities directed against our operations 
and facilities, pipelines, transportation or digital 
infrastructure could cause harm to people and 
severely disrupt operations. Our activities could 
also be severely affected by conflict, civil strife or 
political unrest.
Product quality:  supplying customers with off-
specification products could damage our 
reputation, lead to regulatory action and legal 
liability, and impact our financial performance.
Failure to meet product quality specifications 
could cause harm to people and the 
environment, damage our reputation, result in 
regulatory action and legal liability, and impact 
financial performance.
Compliance and control risks
Ethical misconduct and non-compliance:  ethical 
misconduct or breaches of applicable laws by 
our businesses or our employees could be 
damaging to our reputation, and could result in 
litigation, regulatory action and penalties.
Incidents of ethical misconduct or non-
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, 
including anti-bribery and corruption, competition 
and antitrust, data privacy, and anti-fraud laws, 
trade restrictions or other sanctions, could 
damage our reputation, and result in litigation, 
regulatory action, penalties and potentially affect 
our licence to operate. In relation to trade 
restrictions or other sanctions, current 
geopolitical factors have increased these risks.
Regulation:  changes in the law and regulation 
could increase costs, constrain our operations 
and affect our strategy, business plans and 
financial performance.
Our businesses and operations are subject to the 
laws and regulations applicable in each country, 
state or other regional or local area in which they 
occur. These laws and regulations result in an 
often complex, uncertain and changing legal and 
regulatory environment for our global businesses 
and operations. Changes in laws or regulations, 
including how they are interpreted and enforced, 
can and do impact all aspects of our business.
Royalties and taxes, particularly those applied to 
our hydrocarbon activities, tend to be high 
compared with those imposed on similar 
commercial activities. In certain jurisdictions 
there is also a degree of uncertainty relating to 
tax law interpretation and changes.Governments may change their fiscal and 
regulatory frameworks in response to public 
pressure on finances or for other policy reasons, 
resulting in increased amounts payable to them 
or their agencies.
Changes in law or regulation could increase the 
compliance and litigation risk and costs, reduce 
our profitability, reduce demand for or constrain 
our ability to sell certain products, limit our 
access to new opportunities, require us to divest 
or write down certain assets or curtail or cease 
certain operations, or affect the adequacy of our 
provisions for pensions, tax, decommissioning, 
environmental and legal liabilities. Changes in 
laws or regulations could result in the 
nationalization, expropriation, cancellation, non-
renewal or renegotiation of our interests, assets 
and related rights. Potential changes to pension 
or financial market regulation could also impact 
funding requirements of the group. Following the 
Gulf of America oil spill, we may be subjected to a 
higher level of fines or penalties imposed in 
relation to any alleged breaches of laws or 
regulations, which could result in increased costs.
Regulation of the group’s business, 
pages 329-334
Trading and treasury trading activities:  
ineffective oversight of trading and treasury 
trading activities could lead to business 
disruption, financial loss, regulatory intervention 
or damage to our reputation and affect our 
permissions to trade.
We are subject to operational risk around our 
trading and treasury trading activities in financial 
and commodity markets, some of which are 
regulated. Failure to process, manage and 
monitor a large number of complex transactions 
across many markets and currencies while 
complying with all regulatory requirements could 
hinder profitable trading opportunities. There is a 
risk that a single trader or a group of traders 
could act outside of our delegations and 
controls, leading to regulatory intervention and 
resulting in financial loss, fines and potentially 
damaging our reputation, and could affect our 
permissions to trade.
Financial statements – Note 29
Reporting:  failure to accurately report our data 
could lead to regulatory action, legal liability and 
reputational damage.
External reporting of financial and non-financial 
data, including reserves estimates, relies on the 
integrity of the control environment, our systems 
and people operating them. Failure to report data 
accurately and in compliance with applicable 
standards could result in regulatory action, legal 
liability and damage to our reputation.Strategic report

Thunderhorse, US Gulf of America


Our governance framework is designed to be 
dynamic, flexible and robust.
Dear fellow shareholders,
The role of a board as custodian of the 
company’s assets has even greater significance 
in times of volatility, uncertainty and change. The 
unpredictable macro environment in 2024 
offered both opportunities and challenges for 
global energy companies. Many of bp’s 
businesses performed well but there were also 
challenges in parts of the customers & products 
business. Overall, it was a year of reshaping the 
portfolio and laying the foundations for bp’s 
strategy reset in February 2025. The strategy we 
have set out provides clarity about direction and 
priorities, and the board will now focus its 
attention overseeing strategic execution and 
performance management. 
Evolving governance framework 
The board’s corporate governance framework is 
a robust basis to challenge and guide the 
leadership team in good times, but also in the 
tougher times we have experienced. It has been 
instrumental in helping the board to navigate 
multiple, rigorous discussions and – ultimately – 
the decisions we took in 2024, culminating, more 
recently, in February’s strategy reset. 
Our governance framework is designed to be 
dynamic, flexible and robust. This meant that 
when the new UK Corporate Governance Code 
was published at the start of 2024, we could 
largely deploy our existing processes to plan for 
meeting its requirements, adding elements 
where appropriate while avoiding duplication and 
minimizing extra work. 
The terms of reference for the board and the 
board committees were updated in July, with 
further changes to the board and audit 
committee terms of reference in January 2025, 
reflecting the staggered timetable of the changes 
coming into force under the new code. 
Considering the new requirement for an internal 
control effectiveness statement, we intend to 
make this statement in 2027 in respect of our 
2026 annual report, having sought appropriate 
external assurance. Meaningful engagement 
Every year, we seek to engage widely with you, 
our shareholders, but also with our own people, 
partners, advisers and governments. 
A highlight of 2024 was the board’s trip to India. 
This was an invaluable experience for the board 
in a strategically significant region for bp. We 
travelled to three cities, meeting partners, 
suppliers and the government – and bp’s teams 
working on lubricants, developing technical 
solutions and helping to run our operations 
safely (see page 78 ).
The board also met many other teams across 
the world, through our bespoke workforce 
engagement programme. This is designed to 
allow our directors to meet our people directly, 
throughout bp (see page 78 ).
Our 2024 workforce engagement agenda was 
aligned closely with the topics we discussed in 
reviewing and considering our strategic options 
at board meetings during the year. The views and 
feedback obtained played an important part in 
informing the board’s decisions. This programme 
of listening to and working with our people will 
continue through 2025 – especially during an 
ongoing transformation programme.
Progress on culture 
The board places great importance in assessing 
and monitoring bp’s culture. Whenever 
necessary, it seeks the leadership team’s 
assurance that action will be taken should 
practices or behaviours not align with the 
company’s culture frame, which sets out ‘Who 
we are’. The board set up a temporary committee 
in 2023 to provide direct oversight on culture. It 
served bp well and its responsibilities have now 
been assumed by the people, culture and 
governance committee.As chair of this committee, I am pleased with the 
start we have made in 2024 with the committee’s 
expanded scope on culture and, in particular, 
with a focus on psychological safety and 
speaking up. We will seek to make further 
progress on this area during 2025 (for more on 
the people, culture and governance committee’s 
work, see  page 86 ).
Board composition 
The people, culture and governance committee is 
continuously working to identify potential 
candidates to join the board. The reset strategy 
bp announced in February 2025 provides the 
committee with a clear framework to identify 
new board members who will bring the additional 
skills and experience bp needs as it embarks on 
the next chapter.
Closing thanks 
I am grateful to my fellow board members for 
everything they have done this year – and 
everything they continue to do. On behalf of the 
board, I would also like to thank the leadership 
team and bp teams across the world for what 
they achieved in 2024, for their relentless focus 
on safety and their commitment to bp. And I will 
close by thanking you, fellow shareholders, for 
your support and your challenges. Your 
contributions improve the board’s decision 
making – and help to improve bp.

Executive leadership
bp leadership team
bp’s governance framework helps to drive informed 
and efficient decision making through a clear 
division of responsibilities. This enables bp to 
operate effectively and in alignment with the 
strategy as set by the board.
Responsibilities of the board 
The board is appointed by shareholders. Its 
responsibility, through the directors, is to promote 
the success of the company, to drive value for 
shareholders, having regard for the company’s 
stakeholders and the consequences of decisions in 
the long term. Fulfilling this role, the board is 
responsible for setting and overseeing the 
implementation of the company’s strategy, purpose 
and values. The board’s oversight includes 
monitoring culture and the effectiveness of the 
company’s system of internal control.
More detailed information about board activities is 
available from page 76 . 
Delegation of authority
The board delegates certain responsibilities 
to its principal committees, which are outlined 
in their respective terms of reference at 
bp.com/governance . 
Day-to-day management of the business is 
delegated to the chief executive officer (CEO), who in 
turn is advised and supported by a leadership team 
(bpLT) comprising of nine individuals who are 
accountable to him for their respective business and 
functional areas, with appropriate financial authority 
levels. Ultimately, decisions are taken by the CEO in 
the execution of the delegations to him by the board. For example, the CEO’s authority includes a limit on 
investments, capital expenditure « and financial 
commitments. Any matters in excess of this limit, or 
those that go beyond the annual plan or agreed 
strategy, remain a matter reserved for the board as 
a whole. 
Further delegations of authority are maintained 
throughout the business in a consistent way.
Board committees
The four principal board committees operate 
under terms of reference which are reviewed 
at least annually. Full details can be found at 
bp.com/governance . 
Each committee reports to the board as a whole, 
providing updates on their activities and, where 
applicable, making recommendations for the 
board’s approval.
Board roles

Regular stakeholder engagement allows directors to gain a wide range of different insights, giving the board a comprehensive and rounded perspective in 
support of the decisions it takes. Engagement of this nature helps the directors to fulfil their statutory duties and build greater trust within, across, and 
outside of bp. In turn this helps improve how the strategy is formed and overseen to promote bp’s long-term success. 
Fostering mutual understanding
òò
The board’s approach to stakeholder 
engagement allows for a better understanding of 
matters that are important and relevant to the 
decisions that they take and to the continuing 
evolution of bp’s strategy. 
For the non-executive directors (NEDs), one of 
the key mechanisms for engagement is the 
workforce engagement programme (WFEP). 
Every NED takes part in the WFEP, joining small 
group roundtable sessions with employees on a 
specific topic. Key themes addressed through 
the WFEP in 2024 included safety, innovation and 
technology, remuneration, and culture.
In addition, for employees, directors have been 
involved in town hall events and webcasts during 
the year.
For investors, engagement mechanisms 
included roadshows, results calls, one-to-one 
and group meetings.
bp’s financial and operational performance was 
an important topic for both investors and the 
workforce in 2024, with directors seeking to 
enhance each group’s understanding of the 
factors affecting the company’s overall 
performance.
Promoting balanced perspectives
òòòò
In 2024, engagements included sessions with 
employees in Australia, India, Spain, the UK and 
US; summits and meetings with governments 
and regulators from Azerbaijan, Germany, 
Kuwait, India and Iraq; and customer-focused 
visits to sites in the UK, US and India. 
In particular, the board’s visit to our business and 
technology centers in Pune, India in September 
provided a breadth of stakeholder engagement 
opportunities, supporting the delivery of bp’s 
ambitions. For more on the visit to Pune see 
page 83.  
In addition to regular meetings with investors in 
2024, bp held its first hybrid retail shareholder 
engagement event outside of the AGM, hosted by 
the company secretary. Feedback from this 
event was used to enhance engagement by the 
board at the AGM.Focusing strategic direction
òòòòòò
The strategy reset announced in February 2025 
was developed through a comprehensive 
engagement programme undertaken in 2024 and 
early 2025. The perspectives of various 
stakeholders were considered including investors 
and our employees. Wide-ranging views helped 
to inform the decisions taken by the board 
regarding the strategy reset. This engagement 
supported the board’s confidence that their 
decisions had taken account of evolving 
stakeholder expectations.
See more on key decisions, page 79
Building trust in bp
òòò
Two important themes in helping to maintain and 
enhance organizational trust are safety 
performance and culture. 
On safety, valuable insights were gained from 
investors, employees and business partners via 
in-person meetings, online meetings and director 
site visits. Examples this year included visits to 
the Castellón refinery in Spain and operations in 
the Permian Basin in the US. 
Culture was a prominent theme of WFEP 
sessions in 2024 with valuable feedback shared 
on culture at bp, including the impact of agile 
working and leadership training programmes.  
In addition, directors continued to advocate for 
bp’s culture of speaking up, and the board 
reviewed an anonymized summary of Pulse 
employee survey reports and OpenTalk reports 
(bp’s whistleblowing service). For more on 
culture see page 87.
Opportunities for collaboration
òòòòò
By attending talks, events and site visits with our 
partners and suppliers (such as Reliance, Infosys 
and Aviation Fuelling Services at Heathrow 
airport (UK)), the board had the opportunity to 
discuss and learn more about safety, technology 
and the future of the energy sector.
Similarly, engagements with governments and 
regulators and consideration of wider society’s 
interests focused on generating shared value. 
For example, investment opportunities (Kaskida 
platform, Gulf of America), redevelopment 
opportunities (Kirkuk Field, Iraq) and exploration 
of lower carbon energy solutions (Net Zero 
Teesside Power, UK). The directors also reflected on integration, safety 
and customer-centricity on their visits to retail 
sites such as TravelCenters of America in the 
US and the Hemel Hempstead fuel terminal in 
the UK. 
Benchmarking progress
òòòòòò
Stakeholder engagement enhances the board’s 
ability to benchmark our progress against peers 
and to innovate, ultimately benefiting our 
shareholders, workforce, customers, suppliers 
and business partners, and the communities 
where bp operates. 
Our Section 172(1) statement describes 
how the directors have had regard to the 
matters set out in Section 172(1)(a) to (f) 
of the Companies Act 2006; see page 68.

78 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024


Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 requires directors to act in a way they believe will promote the success of the company for the benefit of its 
shareholders. They must consider the long-term impact of their decisions, the interests of employees, relationships with stakeholders, the community and 
environment, and maintain high standards of business conduct. 
Set out below are four key decisions taken by the board during 2024 and how stakeholder considerations have been taken into account in the board’s 
discussions and decision making. 
Resetting our strategy
The board approved a reset of bp’s strategy 
and reallocation of capital to drive growth and 
improved performance, as announced at the 
Capital Markets Update on 26 February 2025.
This announcement followed extended 
workshops and board discussions with 
members of the bp leadership team at each 
board meeting since September 2023, leading 
to what the board believes is a clear and 
distinctive strategic direction, an investable 
financial proposition, with a simpler narrative, 
sustainability framework, financial frame and 
metrics. 
Throughout the process, the board explored 
what drives valuation growth across three 
quantitative pillars – growth, profitability, and 
risk – along with qualitative factors like 
investor proposition, market confidence, and 
the company’s performance during the year. bp’s investors want to see consistent 
operational and financial performance, together 
with strategic clarity with less complexity. The 
board discussed choices on capital allocation 
and efficiency, balance sheet resilience and 
share buyback guidance. 
When looking at the potential strategic options, 
the board also considered bp’s sustainability 
framework.
Recognizing the feedback to become a simpler 
and more understandable organization, the 
board considered the perspectives of various 
stakeholders including investors and our 
employees before approving the five focused 
sustainability aims of net zero operations «, net 
zero sales «, people, water and biodiversity. Throughout the process the board explored 
potential scenarios, opportunities, and risks.  
This ultimately led to decisions being taken 
that the board believes will best maximize bp’s 
prospect of achieving its objectives and 
fulfilling its purpose. The board believes the 
strategy remains consistent with the goals of 
the Paris Agreement. Recognizing that the 
component parts of this update are important 
to many stakeholder groups, the board 
remains committed to the energy transition.   
Stakeholders considered
òòòòòò
An integrated energy company
As an integrated energy company, bp 
continues to invest with discipline in both the 
upstream « and low carbon energy. In 2024, 
the board approved key investment decisions 
in each of these segments.
In July, bp took a final investment decision for 
a sixth operated hub, Kaskida, in the US Gulf 
of America. This strategic growth project 
represents bp’s ongoing commitment to 
invest in this prolific high-margin basin, and 
makes up an important element of growing 
the value of bp. This platform is expected to 
have production capacity of 80,000 barrels of 
oil per day and will embrace a more simplified, 
standardized and cost-efficient platform 
design that we plan to replicate in future 
projects, unlocking potential for the 
development of 10 billion barrels of discovered 
resources in place in the Paleogene, Gulf of 
America.Together with our partners we reached financial 
close for two major carbon capture and storage 
(CCS) projects in Teeside in the north-east of 
England: the Northern Endurance Partnership 
(NEP) and Net Zero Teesside Power (NZT 
Power). NEP, through its CO 2 transport and 
storage system, will help develop and underpin 
a lower carbon future for industry in the region.  
NZT Power, a gas-fired power station with CCS, 
will provide flexible low carbon power into the 
UK national power grid. The two projects will 
capture and transport millions of tonnes of CO 2 
and the board noted the potential from these 
projects to support thousands of jobs through 
their construction and operation.The NZT Power and NEP decisions were taken 
following extensive dialogue with multiple 
stakeholders, including discussions with 
governments regarding local policies and with 
our customers to ensure an accessible 
market. The board recognized the contribution 
of the NZT Power and NEP decisions to bp’s 
strategic priorities, including the high grading 
of our hydrogen and CCS projects and the role 
these projects can play in helping advance the 
UK’s journey to net zero. 
In the US, the board was supportive of the 
high-value growth opportunity presented by 
Kaskida and the contribution it could make to 
deliver secure, reliable and affordable energy.

Dear fellow shareholders, 
I am pleased to present the safety and 
sustainability committee report for the year 
ended 31 December 2024. 
Safety performance remained a focal point for 
the committee during the year, with the 
committee observing significant progress made 
in reducing tier 1 process safety incidents. This 
included overseeing management’s progress in 
the implementation of Process Safety 
Improvement Plans (PSIPs) across the company, 
with deeper dives on personal safety, operational 
integrity and threat risk across a number of our 
businesses and operations. 
Tragically, we lost a colleague in our recently 
acquired bp bioenergy business in Brazil from 
injuries sustained during an operational activity. 
We extend our deep condolences to his family 
and colleagues. Management reported on the 
actions being taken to embed the bp Operational 
Management System across bp bioenergy and to 
learn from this incident. 
The committee undertook a number of site visits 
to engage with employees and observe bp’s 
safety and sustainability culture and 
performance in person. The committee members 
appreciated the candour and culture experienced 
at each site visited, details on  page 81.  
Looking forward to 2025, the committee will 
focus its oversight on maintaining the good 
progress and continuous improvement in safety 
performance and implementation of the updated 
sustainability aims (further detail on  page 38 ).
Role of the committee
The committee oversees the management of 
safety and sustainability matters, including 
relevant systems and processes, focusing on 
those which it considers to be most potentially 
material from time to time.

Committee chair
6 March 2025Activities during the year 
Overseeing improved safety 
performance
•One primary focus of the committee is the 
oversight of safety performance, critically 
analysing management’s progress in the 
reduction of tier 1 and 2 process safety 
events«. During 2024, the committee 
oversaw improved tier 1 safety performance, 
with tier 1 safety events being 67% lower than 
in 2023.
•Additionally, the committee oversaw the 
implementation of PSIPs to address a 17% 
increase in tier 2 safety events in the year. 
This included overseeing the continued 
embedding of the Refining, Terminals and 
Pipelines 5-Point Plan, created as a priority 
initiative following fatalities at the Toledo 
refinery in September 2022.
•In addition, the committee received:
– Routine updates from the EVP production 
& operations on safety and operational 
performance and key safety moments 
from around the business.
– Reports on major operational, security 
(including crisis management and 
business continuity) and cyber security 
incidents (for example, detail on learnings 
from the global CrowdStrike outage in 
July 2024).
– Deep-dive updates regarding significant or 
material events and specific risk areas 
within the business, including a fatality at 
Guariroba mill in our recently acquired bp 
bioenergy business in Brazil from 
exposure to steam at extreme 
temperature, and a full shutdown at 
Whiting refinery in the US resulting from a 
power outage. The committee challenged 
management on the root cause and 
learnings from these incidents and how 
learnings are embedded into existing 
safety processes.
– The committee also made 
recommendations to the remuneration 
committee regarding safety remuneration 
targets and outcomes. This included 
critically analysing current methodologies 
for the setting of targets to ensure they 
are appropriately achievable while 
remaining stretching.Safety and sustainability committee
80 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024


Providing challenge on risk 
management
• The committee plays an important role in the 
bp risk management process, providing 
independent challenge to management on the 
processes and procedures implemented to 
manage safety and sustainability risk. This is 
achieved by reviewing and monitoring the 
principal risks allocated to it by the board 
through deep-dive updates, for example 
related to wells, product quality and ethical 
misconduct and non-compliance.
•Proactive deep-dives are made into specific 
areas of risk within the business. For 
example, the committee began receiving 
enhanced reporting on risk management 
within the bpx energy business, which 
continued into 2024. This reporting has 
allowed the committee to challenge the 
business on the cascading of safety learnings 
and implementation of process safety 
improvement plans, demonstrated by 
improved safety performance within bpx 
energy during 2024.•Routine updates on the activity of internal 
audit are received by the committee, including 
an annual report on bp’s system of internal 
control. This supports the committee by 
providing an independent view on 
management’s safety and sustainability 
performance, helping to draw out where key 
challenges and risk areas may lie.
Guiding delivery against strategy 
and aims TCFD
•The committee oversees progress against 
bp’s sustainability aims through receiving 
routine updates from the SVP sustainability. 
During 2024, deep-dives were undertaken into 
each pillar of the sustainability frame, with 
regular focus on management’s plans to 
address areas of more challenged delivery.
•The committee remains abreast of the 
current global sustainability reporting 
environment, including bp’s plans for 
compliance. For example, in November, the 
committee received a joint update with the 
audit committee on bp’s plans for compliance 
with the EU Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive and EU Taxonomy 
Regulation.•Recommendations were made to the 
remuneration committee regarding 
sustainability-linked remuneration targets and 
outcomes. For example, the committee made 
a recommendation to the remuneration 
committee to move the 2024 annual cash 
bonus target from sustainable emissions 
reductions to one based on operational 
emissions reductions (see remuneration 
report on page 88 ).

Insights from Castellón refinery, 
Spain – July 2024
During the S&SC’s trip to Castellón refinery 
the team provided an insight into its 
implementation of the 5-Point Plan and 
other PSIPs. The team also briefed the 
committee on the cascading of learnings 
following a fatality on-site in 2021, including 
consequent reinforcement of the Life Saving 
Rules on-site and piloting of a bespoke 
safety programme (Safety in Mind) to 
embed human performance principles of 
safety on-site. In addition, the committee 
was briefed on plans to develop the asset’s 
green hydrogen « operations.

Dear fellow shareholders, 
I am pleased to present the audit committee 
report for the year ended 31 December 2024.
At the heart of the committee’s role is bp’s 
financial reporting – monitoring its continued 
integrity, overseeing management’s control 
procedures and assessing their effectiveness 
and working with internal and external auditors to 
ensure that what you – our shareholders – rely 
on in our reporting has been appropriately 
challenged and reviewed. This is work we 
undertake on behalf of the board, co-ordinating 
with some of the board’s other committees for 
their relevant input and ultimately making 
recommendations to the board in support of the 
governance processes we have established.
In pursuit of this agenda, the committee oversaw 
significant change in bp’s reporting processes in 
the year, with the introduction of trading 
statements which are now issued shortly after 
the end of the quarter to provide up-to-date 
performance insights.
A highlight of our activity during the year has 
included monitoring progress against bp’s target 
relating to the delivery of savingsb, and the 
committee will continue to monitor progress in 
2025 following the announcement on 26 
February 2025 to deliver between $4-5 billion of 
structural cost reductions « by the end of 2027. 
An additional highlight was a deep-dive into how 
bp manages risks associated with the integration 
of acquisitions.
Against the backdrop of an ever-changing 
regulatory environment, the committee has 
engaged with management to assess bp’s 
approach to new sustainability reporting and the 
requirements of the new UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2024, receiving regular 
updates on implementation and plans for 
compliance.
We spent time with the trading and shipping 
team (now the supply, trading and shipping 
team) in Houston, US and our business and 
technology centers in Pune, India, both being 
strategically significant areas of bp’s business. 
Read more on page 83 . The committee 
continues to engage with other stakeholders 
where appropriate, including through regulatory 
inspections when they occur.
On behalf of my colleagues on the committee, I 
would like to extend my thanks for the continued 
professional support and focus of effort by 
management and our various advisers during a 
year where bp delivered strong performance in 
some areas but had some challenges in others. 
We look forward to continuing this journey 
through 2025.Role of the committee 
The committee monitors the effectiveness of 
the group’s financial reporting, including ESG 
and climate-related financial disclosures, as 
well as systems of internal control and risk 
management as allocated by the board. It also

Activities during the year
Monitoring the integrity of financial 
reporting and assurance
•Through monitoring and reviewing that bp’s 
financial statements and formal 
announcements relating to bp’s financial 
performance are clear and appropriate, the 
committee oversees the integrity of our 
financial reporting.
•Management’s application of key accounting 
policies and recommendations on financial 
reporting judgements was carefully 
considered, with the committee concluding 
that these matters were appropriately 
addressed in the financial statements.
•The committee oversaw change in bp’s 
reporting processes, playing a key role in 
reviewing the governance, assurance and 
reporting arrangements for trading 
statements, which were introduced for the 
first quarter of 2024 with the aim of providing 
performance insights to investors ahead of 
the release of quarterly results.
•The committee monitored progress and 
reporting on cost savings. 
Going concern, viability and fair, balanced 
and understandable considerations
The committee reviewed the company’s going 
concern assumption and longer-term viability 
statement. In determining and recommending to 
the board that it was appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting and the 
longer-term viability of the company, the 
committee considered carefully (and challenged 
constructively where appropriate) for example 
certain enhancements to the longer-term viability 
statement as found on page 113 .
The committee received an update from 
management on the verification process for the 
bp Annual Report and Form 20-F in support of its 
recommendation to the board that the annual 
report was fair, balanced and understandable. 
The bp Annual Report and Form 20-F was 
comprehensively reviewed with input from 
subject matter experts and the external auditors. 
The committee’s review included consideration 
of bp’s non-financial disclosures such as the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) that are made in compliance 
with the UK Listing Rules.  TCFD
Maintaining resilience through 
systems of internal control and 
risk management
•The committee oversaw risk management 
and internal control processes, routinely 
reviewing and monitoring principal risks 
allocated to it by the board through a 
combination of business or function reviews 
and focused engagement with key 
stakeholders.•Through a deep-dive update, the committee 
discussed bp’s approach to acquisition 
integration. The session focused on the 
implementation of revised policies and 
requirements to manage risk and reduce 
complexity in aligning new acquisitions with 
bp’s control environment.
•Through supply, trading and shipping 
updates, the committee reviewed risks to 
trading such as market, liquidity, credit, 
operational and people risks and control 
items. In light of the changing macro and 
energy price environment, the committee 
considered the LNG hedging strategy ahead 
of the winter period, and reviewed and 
challenged the longer-term outlook for energy 
prices against bp’s price assumptions.
•The committee reviewed the affordability of 
distributions, taking into account factors such 
as whether sufficient distributable reserves 
are available.
•In addition, the committee received:
– updates on the systems in place to assess 
fraud risk and the controls in place to 
manage and mitigate identified risks.
– an update on compliance with business 
regulations, together with additional 
briefings during the year on technical 
accounting updates and developing ESG 
disclosures. TCFD
•The committee remained prepared for 
regulatory developments, including receiving 
updates on the consideration of 
enhancements to bp's risk management and 
internal control framework as a result of the 
new 2024 UK Corporate Governance Code, 
and received updates on implementation 
progress.
Effectiveness of risk management and 
systems of internal control
The committee reviewed and challenged 
management on the effectiveness of the system 
of internal control and agreed that it did not 
require further action nor were there any 
significant failings or weaknesses to report. As 
part of this assessment the committee 
considered internal audit’s annual review of 
internal control and risk management, together 
with an assessment of it from management. 
Further details can be found on pages 112-113 .   
The committee also discussed internal controls 
and financial reporting processes during the year, 
challenging control gaps identified and 
subsequent actions to remediate, and reviewed 
progress towards addressing deficiencies that 
had been previously identified in relation to 
manual journal controls. Further details on 
internal controls in place for financial reporting 
can be found on page 336.  
In addition, the committee received updates 
on the evolution and enhancement of non-

Overseeing the relationship with 
external and internal audit
•On the recommendation of the committee, 
the board will propose the reappointment of 
Deloitte as our external auditor to 
shareholders at the 2025 annual general 
meeting. The external auditor’s independence 
and objectivity were reviewed and monitored 
by the committee using a combination of 
factors, including assurances provided to it by 
the external auditor, the level of non-audit 
fees, and the timeline for lead audit partner 
rotation and re-tender of audit services. The 
committee was satisfied with the audit team’s 
effectiveness, service quality and 
commitment, including that the external 
auditor provides constructive challenge to 
management. In support of this, the 
committee received reports from the external 
auditor that covered insights from their audit 
work, actions taken to address the FRC’s 
annual report on the external auditor, and the 
inspection results of the external auditor’s 
quality control procedures. In addition, the 
committee received reports from 
management, which included a survey 
seeking internal stakeholder feedback on the 
external auditor’s performance and bp’s 
commitment to the audit. The main 
measurement criteria covered planning and 
scope, robustness of audit, independence and 
objectivity, quality of delivery, quality of people 
and service, and value-added advice.
•The committee met privately with the external 
auditor during the year, and in addition 
reviewed, approved and monitored progress 
against the external audit plan, considering 
materiality levels, audit risks, scoping 
changes, and resourcing. The committee is 
satisfied that the external auditor has full 
access to staff and records.•The committee continued to monitor and 
review the effectiveness and capabilities of 
the internal audit function. This included for 
example reviewing and approving the internal 
audit plan in the context of bp’s principal risks 
and discussing an update on actions taken in 
response to the recommendations of an 
external quality assessment conducted by 
PwC in 2022. The committee concluded that 
the function had independent, unrestricted 
scope, access to information, and sufficient 
resources to fulfil its mandate. They met 
privately with the SVP internal audit, 
discussed regular updates on internal audit 
activities and where appropriate challenged 
management’s response and progress made 
on the closure of findings.
A summary of the external audit approach, 
including audit risks, is set out in the independent 
auditor’s report on pages 116-133 .
Lead audit partner rotation and 
re-tender of audit services
The external auditor must rotate the lead audit 
partner every five years and other senior staff 
every five to seven years.
The company complies with the Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014, which requires 
bp to tender the audit at least every 10 years.
External audit services were last tendered in 
2016 and the external auditor has been in that 
role since 2018 (seven years). It is anticipated 
that a re-tender will be completed by 2026, for 
the 2028 audit. The committee believes that the 
timeline is in the best interests of shareholders, 
providing an appropriate balance between 
knowledge of controls and risks, maintaining 
audit quality, independence and objectivity and 
value for money.Oversight of audit fees and
non-audit services
The committee reviewed and approved the audit 
services fee and terms of engagement for the 
external auditor while retaining oversight of bp’s 
policy on non-audit services and the review and 
approval of non-audit services.
The total amount of audit and non-audit 
fees paid to Deloitte for 2024 is set out in 
Financial statements – Note 36 . The committee 
is satisfied that the audit fee is appropriate in 
respect of the audit services provided. The 
majority of non-audit fees relate to work of an 
assurance nature.
The non-audit services policy safeguards audit 
objectivity and independence through the 
prohibition of non-audit tax services being 
provided by the external auditor, the limitation of 
audit-related work which falls within defined

Key accounting judgements and estimates Audit committee activity Conclusions/outcomes
Provisions
The group holds provisions primarily for decommissioning, 
environmental remediation and litigation. The most significant 
provision is for the future decommissioning of oil and natural 
gas production facilities and pipelines. Estimation uncertainty 
exists as most of these events are many years in the future. 
Assumptions are made by bp in relation to cost estimation, 
settlement dates, technology, legal requirements and discount 
rates. There is also a risk that decommissioning obligations 
from previously divested assets revert to bp.•Received briefings on decommissioning (including the 
process for managing the risk of decommissioning 
reversion), environmental, asbestos and litigation 
provisions. These included the requirements, 
governance and controls for the development and 
approval of cost estimates and provisions in the 
financial statements.
•Reviewed and challenged the group’s discount rates 
for calculating provisions.•Decommissioning provisions of $11.8 billion were 
recognized on the balance sheet at 31 December 2024.
•The discount rate used by bp to determine the balance 
sheet obligation at the end of 2024 was a nominal rate 
of 4.5% based on long-dated US government bonds, an 
increase of 0.5% from 2023.
Recoverability of asset carrying values
Determination as to whether and how much an asset (including 
exploration intangibles), cash generating unit (CGU) or group of 
CGUs containing goodwill is impaired involves management 
judgement and estimates on uncertain matters such as future 
commodity prices, discount rates, production profiles, reserves 
and the impact of inflation on operating expenses. Judgement 
is required to determine whether it is appropriate to continue to 
carry intangible assets related to exploration costs on the 
balance sheet.•Reviewed policy and guidelines for compliance with oil 
and gas reserves disclosure regulation, including the 
group’s reserves governance framework and controls.
•Reviewed and challenged the group’s oil and gas price 
assumptions.
•Reviewed and challenged the group’s discount rates 
for impairment testing purposes.
•Impairment charges, reversals and ‘watch-list’ items 
were reviewed in the quarterly due diligence process. •The group’s price assumption for Brent oil and for 
Henry Hub gas were updated as set out on page 20  
and Financial Statements – Note 1.
•Sensitivity analyses estimating the effect of changes in 
net revenue and discount rate assumptions have been 
disclosed in Financial Statements – Note 1.
•Net impairment charges of $5.2 billion as disclosed in 
Financial Statements – Note 4.
•Exploration intangibles totalled $4.4 billion at 31 
December 2024.
Taxation
Computation of the group’s income tax expense and liability, the 
provisioning for potential tax liabilities and the level of deferred 
tax asset recognition are underpinned by management 
judgement and estimation of the amounts which could be 
payable. Judgement is also required when determining whether 
a particular tax is an income tax or another tax type.•Received regular updates on the group’s tax risk 
exposures and deferred tax asset recognition.
•Reviewed the judgements exercised over tax risk 
provisioning as part of its annual review of key 
provisions.•Deferred tax assets of $5.4 billion were recognized on 
the balance sheet at 31 December 2024.  
•The calculation of tax risk provisions is consistent with 
IAS 37 and IFRIC 23.
Pensions
Accounting for pensions and other post-employment benefits 
involves making estimates when measuring the group’s 
pension plan surpluses and deficits. These estimates require 
assumptions to be made about uncertain events, including 
discount rates, inflation and life expectancy.•Reviewed and challenged the group’s assumptions 
used to determine the projected benefit obligation at 
the year end, including the discount rate, rate of 
inflation, salary growth and mortality levels.•At 31 December 2024, surpluses of $7.5 billion and 
deficits of $4.9 billion were recognized on the balance 
sheet in relation to pensions and other post-
employment benefits.
•The method for determining the group’s assumptions 
remained largely unchanged from 2023. The values of 
these assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of the 
impact of possible changes on the benefit expense and 
obligation are provided in Financial Statements – Note 
24.
Supplier finance arrangements
The group’s trade payables include certain supplier finance 
arrangements that utilize letter of credit facilities and 
promissory notes. Judgement is required to assess trade 
payables subject to supplier financing arrangements to 
determine whether they should continue to be classified as 
trade payables and give rise to operating cash flows or 
finance debt and financing cash flows. •Received a briefing on the group’s supplier finance 
arrangements.
•Reviewed the group’s proposed enhanced disclosures

Dear fellow shareholders,
I am pleased to present the people, culture and 
governance committee (PCGC) report for the 
year ended 31 December 2024.
2024 has been a busy year for the committee, 
with a strong focus on leadership succession 
and development. This is to position bp to 
leverage the skills and experience we have in 
pursuit of our strategy.
In 2023 our emergency executive succession 
plans were tested – successfully – with the 
appointments of Murray Auchincloss and Kate 
Thomson into interim positions, prior to their 
permanent appointments as CEO and CFO in 
January and February 2024 respectively. 
Following the board’s decision in January 2024 
to appoint Murray Auchincloss as our permanent 
CEO, the committee oversaw the launch of a new 
leadership team structure.
Succession and development plans for executive 
roles across the short, medium and long term 
have been refreshed and are routinely reviewed 
by the committee. The committee also revised 
emergency succession plans, which will continue 
to be assessed and reviewed for the key CEO 
and CFO roles. 
Non-executive director succession was also at 
the forefront of the committee’s agenda in 2024, 
seeking candidates who will fulfil the agreed 
criteria for emerging vacancies on our board, 
with a particular focus on a permanent 
successor with the experience to take on the 
chairmanship of the remuneration committee 
and former executives with global, 
transformation experience in large, complex 
industrial companies both from within and 
outside of the sector. This helps us to ensure we 
can maintain an effective board with the 
necessary skills and experience to drive forward 
bp’s strategy. 
We recognize that a strong culture – particularly 
a culture of caring for others and speaking up – 
is vital in times of change. In 2024, the 
committee changed its name from the people 
and governance committee to the PCGC to 
reflect its broader remit in relation to culture and 
engagement, including the monitoring of bp’s 
‘Who we are’ culture frame and how it is being 
embedded. A strong culture requires continuous focus and 
the committee’s enhanced oversight of the 
effectiveness and continual embedding of bp’s 
culture frame will provide valuable insight about 
bp’s culture and areas where further focus is 
required. 
On behalf of my colleagues on the committee, 
I would like to thank the management team 
working to support and advise us in the delivery 
of the committee's priorities and look forward to 
building on the substantial progress made.
Role of the committee
The committee seeks to ensure that the 
composition and structure of the board and 
leadership team remain effective. It also 
monitors the balance of skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity required. The PCGC 
oversees the development of a diverse pipeline 
for succession to the board and leadership team 
through succession planning and monitoring 
development plans for bp leaders and beyond. 
The committee provides oversight of bp’s culture 
and its alignment with our ‘Who we are’ culture 
frame, and monitors sentiment of the workforce.
The process for the nomination, induction and 
orderly succession of candidates for the board, 
the leadership team and the company secretary 
role are led by the committee, as is the annual 
board and committee performance review.
Key responsibilities

a The committee engaged Heidrick & Struggles, Korn Ferry, Spencer Stuart, Egon Zehnder and MWM Consulting in support of search activity for new board candidates. None of the search agents 
have any connection with the company or individual directors, save that Spencer Stuart supports on executive recruitment and Egon Zehnder provides advice and support on bp’s executive 
development programme.
b There is no connection between Independent Board Evaluation and either bp or the individual directors.Activities during the year 
Planning for the future: the board and 
bp’s leadership team
•As set out in our 2023 report, the committee 
endorsed the appointments of Murray 
Auchincloss and Kate Thomson as CEO and 
CFO, respectively in 2024. By routinely 
reviewing succession plans for the board, bp 
leadership team and senior leadership 
positions, and also taking into account the 
skills and diversity profiles we aspire to 
achieve for our leaders, the PCGC prepares 
and shapes bp’s leadership structure to be fit 
for the future.
•The committee oversaw a proposed 
restructuring of bp’s leadership team under 
the new CEO, reflecting the importance of 
organizational focus, simplification, and value 
growth. The new leadership team structure 
was effective from April 2024. Read more on 
page 74 . 
•Through updates from the EVP people, 
culture & communications, the committee 
oversees development plans for bp’s senior 
leaders and emerging talent and their 
alignment with executive succession planning 
over different timescales. Development 
plans identify critical experience and roles 
to bolster the skills of individuals with 
executive potential.
•The committee assessed non-executive 
candidates against agreed criteria for non-
executive rolesa to equip the board with the 
skills and diversity needed to meet current 
and future needs, focusing on candidates 
primarily from the UK and US with industry, 
safety, operational and remuneration 
committee experience. 
Diversity: continued progress
•Early in 2024, the committee recommended 
the appointment of Kate Thomson as CFO for 
approval by the board. Kate is bp’s first 
female CFO. Dame Amanda Blanc was also 
appointed as SID, meaning that 50% of senior 
positions on bp’s board are now represented 
by women, and as a whole the board has 55% 
female representation – this aligns with our 
board diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) 
policy aspiration towards gender parity on 
the board. 
•The committee proposed amendments to the 
board DE&I policy to better inform the board 
and committee's approach to succession 
planning, recognising the benefits of diversity 
to decision-making and outcomes. 
•The board DE&I policy applies to the board 
and its committees, and complements bp’s 
wider diversity policies, the group’s values, 
code of conduct and sustainability frame. 
It includes board gender and ethnicity representation targets aligned with the UK 
Listing Rules and a commitment by directors 
to increase their understanding of all aspects 
of diversity, equity and inclusion. Read more 
at bp.com/governance .
Strengthening oversight of culture 
and the voice of the workforce
•Following the standing down of the culture-
focused ‘Who we are’ oversight committee, 
the PCGC oversaw the roll-out of the 
refreshed bp conflicts of interest policy, which 
incorporates bp’s requirements on 
relationships at work.
•The committee has undertaken work relating 
to its broadened oversight of engagement, 
culture, and how culture has been embedded, 
which included monitoring feedback from the 
workforce on the refreshed conflicts of 
interest policy.
•The committee’s oversight of bp’s culture was 
enhanced through private sessions with bp’s 
head of ethics and compliance (E&C) who has 
accountability to, and direct channels of 
communication with, the PCGC. The 
committee approves the appointment and 
termination of the head of E&C and reviews 
and recommends their remuneration to the 
remuneration committee.
•The workforce engagement programme 
(WFEP) was refined to incorporate culture-
related questions, and quarterly culture-
focused sessions were implemented to help 
the committee understand the workforce’s 
experience of the ‘Who we are’ culture frame. 
The committee provided workforce views and 
feedback to the board, strengthening 
consideration of workforce views in board 
discussions and decisions. The committee 
concluded that the WFEP is the appropriate 
mechanism for workforce engagement, given 
the activities and structure of bp. Read more 
on page 78 .
Enhancing the effectiveness 
of the board
•The board performance review in 2023 
highlighted the importance of the board’s role 
in monitoring culture as an important 
underpin of the company’s performance. This 
led to the broadening of the committee’s 
remit in relation to culture and engagement 
as already discussed within this report. The 
2023 review also triggered a comprehensive 
programme of strategy workshops, 
comprising discussions between the board 
and members of the bp leadership team at 
each board meeting during 2024. This 
concluded with the announcement on 26 
February 2025 that presented a fundamental 
reset of the company’s strategy.•For 2024, the annual board and committee 
performance review was facilitated externally 
by Independent Board Evaluationb (IBE). 
Inputs were sought by IBE from board 
members, key executives and advisors, 
culminating in a discussion about the report 
at our board meeting in March 2025.
•Following this discussion, the board agreed to 
implement actions across the following four 
areas, with the monitoring and tracking of 
these actions delegated to the company 
secretary:
– Succession planning, induction and 
leadership interactions: succession 
planning will focus on the key roles and 
skills required within the board and senior 
management for the new strategy. This 
will include the creation of further 
opportunities or interactions with 
management who have high leadership 
potential.
–Performance management culture : ensure 
that bp has a culture where members of 
the leadership team are held to account 
for performance delivery and capital 
allocation.
– Risk management and governance: more 
in-depth discussions around emerging 
risks and their potential impact on 
organizational resilience and 
sustainability.
Diversity statistics and outcomes
As at 31 December 2024, 55% of the board 
were women, two senior board positions 
were held by women and three directors 
identified as being from a minority ethnic 
background, which exceeds the UK Listing 
Rules targets. For further numerical data on 
the ethnic background and gender identity or 
sex of bp's board and executive 
management, in line with the UK Listing 
Rules, see page 111.
As at 31 December 2024, senior 
management, defined as the leadership 
team (being the first layer of management 
below board level) and the company 
secretary, in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2018, and their 
direct reports comprised 50% women (2023 
51%) and 29% Black, Asian and other ethnic 
minority individuals (2023 26%).
bp has an ethnicity ambition to 2025, read

Chair’s introduction
Dear fellow shareholders, 
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to present 
our 2024 directors’ remuneration report. 
This report provides an overview of our current 
remuneration policy, details the remuneration 
decisions we have made in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2024 and provides a 
summary of how the policy is being implemented 
this year. 
As this is my first report since being appointed as 
interim chair of the remuneration committee in 
April 2024, I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank my predecessor, Paula Rosput Reynolds, 
for her exemplary leadership since 2018. 
I intend to continue in my interim role until at 
least the 2025 AGM in order to provide a robust 
and timely handover with the incoming 
remuneration committee chair once appointed to 
the board.
Business performance
2024 has been a challenging year operationally 
but one in which bp has set the foundations for 
growth as a simpler, more efficient business. 
Significant progress has been made in 2024 to 
focus, high grade and reshape bp’s portfolio. bp 
delivered operating cash flow « of $27.3 billion 
and adjusted EBITDA « of $38.0 billion with 
upstream production 2.0% higher than in 2023.
There were also a number of strategic 
milestones, with final investment decision (FID) 
taken on 10 major projects « and establishing 
key strategic partnerships. 
In July 2024, bp made the FID on the Kaskida 
project in the Gulf of America, demonstrating our 
long-term commitment to delivering reliable and 
affordable energy. Further, progress was made in 
Iraq and India, where we agreed new access on a 
material scale. We have also made progress with 
our renewables business. Significant among 
them were our holdings in Lightsource bp and bp 
Bunge Bioenergia being raised to 100%. In 
addition, the proposed joint venture with JERA 
Co., Inc. will create a leader in offshore wind 
development and help grow the scale of the 
business in a capital-light way for bp.
Alongside this strategic progress, bp delivered 
a $0.8 billion reduction in structural costs « 
during the year, creating a strong platform 
for 2025. 
Nevertheless, it was a difficult year in parts of our 
customers & products businesses, particularly in 
refining. Margins were lower and the significant 
power outage at our refinery in Whiting had a 
direct impact on our operational and financial 
performance during the year, which is in turn 
reflected in remuneration outcomes.
The macroeconomic environment and lower 
prices added to a challenging backdrop.Incentive outcomes
2024 annual bonus 
The 2024 annual bonus was based on a 
scorecard of performance measures across 
three categories: safety and sustainability (30% 
weight), operations (20% weight) and financials 
(50% weight). 
Safety and sustainability 
Safety continues to come first in everything we 
do at bp and we place extensive focus on 
ensuring that our operations run safely every day.
Safety performance is measured against the 
number of tier 1 and tier 2 process safety 
events« (7.5% weight each). The measures are 
assessed independently by the safety and 
sustainability committee, thus providing 
appropriate focus on tier 1 delivery.
The committee is pleased to report that the 
number of tier 1 events was lower in 2024 
compared to the prior year and continues the 
positive trend we have seen in recent years. In 
contrast, there was an increase in the number of 
tier 2 events compared to the prior year, with 35 
events in 2024. This increase has negatively 
impacted results delivering a combined outcome 
of 67% of maximum.
At the start of 2024, a framework was introduced 
to help guide the committee's decisions on the 
impact of fatalities on remuneration outcomes. 
The framework was intended to avoid formulaic 
outcomes vis-à-vis fatalities, instead providing 
guardrails for informed judgement in the 
conclusions we make, while also recognizing that 
every incident is different and should be reflected 
upon individually.
I am saddened to report that there was a fatality 
in October 2024 in the newly acquired bp 
bioenergy business. Details of how the 
framework has been applied in respect of this 
year's bonus outcomes are provided on page 98 . 
We continue our focus on sustainability. This 
was the first year that sustainability performance 
was measured against operated carbon 
emissions (15% weight). bp's performance was 
strong, delivering 1.8Mte ahead of our scorecard 
target, which resulted in an outcome of 84% 
of maximum.
Operations
The reliability « and availability « of our plants 
and refineries were impacted by operational 
challenges throughout the year, including the 
power outage at Whiting in February. This was 
partly offset by strong performance in other 
areas of the business, such as North Africa. 
The bonus outcome, however, was nil for 
this measure. For 2024, we introduced a new operations 
measure that focused on earnings growth in our 
transition growth « engines. Significant 
headwinds in certain parts of the business, along 
with the continued operational challenges within 
our customers & products businesses, resulted 
in this component of the scorecard yielding a nil 
outcome.
Financials 
We have two measures of financial performance: 
annual adjusted EBITDA « and modified free cash 
flow«a. 
In line with policy, we reflect underlying 
performance and hence the targets for both 
financial measures are adjusted for the actual 
price environment. 
Despite recovery in the latter half of the year, 
financial performance was impacted by the 
operational challenges cited elsewhere. Adjusted 
EBITDA delivery at $38.0 billion and modified free 
cash flow at $12.5 billion were both below 
threshold resulting in nil bonus outcomes.
Overall result
The formulaic outcome of the annual bonus was 
below target at 0.45 out of 2.00 (22.5% of 
maximum). 
The committee reflected on this score and 
determined it was appropriate for executive 
directors and the senior leadership of the 
company covering approximately 300 
employees. We did, however, apply discretion 
and award a higher score (but below target) to 
the wider workforce covering over 38,000 eligible 
employees in recognition of motivation and 
engagement levels. bp is undergoing enormous 
transformation and a shrinking workforce will 
carry significant accountability.
2022-24 performance shares 
The 2022-24 performance shares were 
measured against relative TSR (20% weight), 
return on average capital employed « (ROACE) 
(20% weight), adjusted EBIDA per share 
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) « (20% 
weight) and strategic progress (40% weight). 
rTSR
For relative TSR, bp placed sixth in the 
comparator group which resulted in nil vesting 
for this measure.
Financials 
Financial performance was strong over the three-
year performance period and both performance 
measures achieved full vesting. The 2022-24 
average ROACE was 20.9%, significantly 
outperforming expectations. Similarly, adjusted 
EBIDA per share CAGR performance of 11.1% 
exceeded the level required for maximum 
vesting.Corporate governance
« See glossary on page 351 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 89a The directors’ remuneration report in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023  refers to an ‘adjusted free cash flow’ measure in the 2024 annual bonus scorecard. This has the same definition as the 
‘modified free cash flow’ measure reported here.

Strategic progress
Strategic progress was measured based on a 
balance of quantitative assessment and 
qualitative judgement against the three strategic 
pillars set in 2022. This was supplemented with 
the committee’s judgement on overall progress 
in the three years of this plan, especially in the 
final year of the plan. 
As set out in the 2023 directors' remuneration 
report, in terms of the quantitative assessment, 
the committee also took into account value 
generation over the period, rather than focusing 
solely on volume metrics for each pillar of this 
measure. Further, the committee also considered 
the various actions taken by management, 
contextual to our evolving strategy during the 
three-year period. 
We provide a detailed view of the committee’s 
review of strategic progress on pages 100-101. 
Having considered the above, the committee 
determined that while commitments set out in 
early 2022 were not fully realized, good progress 
had been made. An outcome of 66% of 
maximum was felt appropriate for this measure.
Overall result 
Overall, performance share vesting for the 
2022-24 cycle was 66.5% of maximum. The 
committee believes that this final outcome is an 
appropriate reflection of actual performance 
during the period and therefore has not applied 
any further discretion.
In determining the bonus and equity outcomes 
the committee has reviewed incentives 
holistically taking into consideration the total 
remuneration for Murray and Kate (2024 single 
figures of £5.4 million and £1.9 million 
respectively). We determined that this quantum 
for individuals managing a company of bp’s size 
and scale felt appropriate for 2024, taking into 
account both the performance of the company 
and shareholder experience. 
Looking ahead to 2025
Annual pay review
Kate Thomson was appointed to the board on 
2 February 2024 and her remuneration 
arrangements were set in line with our policy. Her 
base pay was set at £800,000, which was at a 
lower level than her predecessor and was based 
on her being newly appointed to the board, while 
also allowing for progression in role over time. 
In last year’s report, we noted that any future 
adjustment to Kate’s base pay may exceed the 
percentage for the wider workforce subject to 
performance in role. Since then, the committee 
has reflected on Kate's performance and her 
competitive positioning against the policy-
determined peer group. During a period of 
significant change for bp, Kate performed 
strongly and displayed impressive leadership 
skills. She has clearly proven her capability over 
the course of the year.In light of Kate’s progression in role and very 
strong performance to date, the committee 
decided that it would be appropriate to increase 
her base pay by 8%. This will be effective from 
the 2025 AGM. 
For Murray Auchincloss, his base pay will 
increase by 4%, which is in line with the increase 
being awarded to the wider workforce.
When reflecting on pay decisions for executive 
directors, the committee remains mindful of the 
transformation drive in the company as well as 
the approach being taken for our wider workforce 
pay. For 2025, the average salary increase in the 
UK will be 4%. Adjustments in other jurisdictions 
vary by local conditions. All employees in the UK 
earn at least the UK Living Wage. 
Review of performance measures
For 2025, in line with policy, we have reviewed 
and aligned the measures of the bonus and 
performance share plan against our reset 
strategy, as set out on 26 February.
Alignment with strategy and financial 
frame 
As outlined by Murray and Kate at the Capital 
Markets Update in February, bp has reset its 
strategy, simplifying our forward-looking 
commitments with four primary targets; adjusted 
free cash flow « growth, structural cost 
reduction, ROACE and net debt «. You will see 
that, where appropriate, these targets form the 
basis for our incentive scorecards.
Consequently, the earnings measure in the 
annual bonus scorecard will be replaced with a 
structural cost reduction measure (25% weight). 
By way of balance, and to signal the importance 
of cash delivery, the modified free cash flow 
measure will increase in weight from 25% to 
30%. 
Reflecting the focus of our strategy, we have 
removed the transition growth engine growth 
measure, and in its place increased the weighting 
of bp-operated reliability and availability from 
10% to 15%. In doing so, we have simplified the 
scorecard from 6 to 5 measures.
Our focus on safety and emissions has not 
changed and therefore the current measures and 
weightings under this category will remain the 
same. 
For performance share awards, we reflected on 
the appropriate mix of financial measures in the 
scorecard for 2025-27 – taking into 
consideration the priorities set out in the strategy 
update. To better reflect the importance of cash 
generation, we have replaced the earnings 
measure with adjusted free cash flow CAGR « in 
our scorecard (20% weight). The committee 
believes the dual focus of modified free cash 
flow in the short term and adjusted free cash 
flow CAGR over the long term is appropriate for 
the scorecards as they bring focus and are 
aligned to bp’s strategy.
Further, we are proposing to align the ROACE 
measure with our external commitments, with 
performance being assessed to the end of 2027 
and adjusted for the environment.
All other measures from the 2024-26 plan remain 
unchanged.
Alignment with stakeholders 
During the year, we continued our practice of 
regular engagement with shareholders. We 
engaged with our top shareholders and investor 
bodies, accounting for over 35% of issued share 
capital, and have taken into consideration their 
views when determining the 2024 remuneration 
outcomes and 2025 performance measures. We 
have tried to strike a balance between broader 
shareholder experience and executive motivation 
in determining the overall bonus and share plan 
outcomes.
Concluding remarks 
I hope that you find this year’s report a clear 
account of the committee’s application of the 
remuneration policy during the year. 
On behalf of the committee, I would like to 
extend my thanks to our various advisors, 
shareholders and investor bodies for their input 
and engagement during the year. While 2024 
was a year of mixed performance, we are 
thankful for the support received and look 
forward to continuing this journey in 2025. 
At the forthcoming AGM there will be an advisory 
vote in respect of the directors’ remuneration 
report and I look forward to your continued 
support of remuneration at bp.

Engaging with our workforce
As a committee, we spend considerable time on matters relating to performance and remuneration arrangements across 
the wider workforce. We believe that our people are the key to bp’s success and our approach to performance and reward 
should be fair and consistent across the organization.
Alignment of executive and workforce remuneration 
All employees Element of remuneration Executive directors
Salary is the basis for a competitive total reward 
package for all employees, and we conduct an annual 
salary review for all non-unionized employees. 
In setting pay budgets, we assess how employee pay is 
currently positioned relative to market rates, wage 
inflation, forecasts and business context.
â S
alaryâT
he salaries of our executive directors are reviewed 
annually, along the same timeline as the wider 
workforce.
The review of salaries will take into account the same 
factors considered for the wider workforce. Salary 
increases for executive directors will typically be at or 
below the workforce rate, other than in specific 
circumstances. 
We operate different pension plans by location and for 
those parts of our business where market practice is 
markedly different, e.g. our retail business.
For our population of non-retail employees in the UK, we 
provide a flexible cash benefits allowance of 20% of 
salary. The benefits available are aligned with 
competitive market practice in our different 
jurisdictions.
â P
ensions and benefitsâE
xecutive directors receive a cash allowance in lieu of 
pension aligned with the wider workforce (currently 20% 
of salary).
Other than the provisions of car, security and tax 
preparation related benefits, benefit packages are 
broadly aligned with those of other employees in 
the UK. 
More than half of the eligible workforce participate in an 
annual cash bonus plan that multiplies a grade-based 
target bonus amount by a bp performance factor 
derived from the bonus scorecard.
Select participants may be nominated to receive an 
uplift to their bonus outcome, reflecting their personal 
contribution and impact.
We operate different bonus plans for those distinct 
parts of our business where market practice is 
markedly different. 
â A
nnual bonus âT
he annual bonus for the executive directors is linked 
to the same bp performance factor as for the wider 
workforce.
Executive directors are not entitled to a bonus uplift 
linked to individual performance. 
For executive directors, a portion of any award is 
deferred into shares for three years. The deferral rate 
depends on whether the executive director has met 
their minimum shareholding requirement. 
We operate share plans with three-year vesting for all 
our senior leaders. 
Opportunity varies across two broad tiers: group 
leaders (approximately 300) and senior-level leaders 
(approximately 4,500). 
â P
erformance sharesâE
xecutive directors are eligible for performance share 
awards, which are subject to stretching performance 
targets over a three-year period. 
An additional three-year post-vesting holding period 
applies for executive directors. 
Other elements of pay 
Recognition 
energize!, our global recognition platform, 
is open to all employees for peer-to-peer 
recognition. The scheme aims to celebrate 
employee’s contributions, highlight behaviours 
vital to our success and drive a performance 
edge. In 2024, a total of 38,800 energize! awards 
were made.
We also operate a spot bonus programme, where 
individuals or teams can be nominated to receive 
a one-off cash award to recognize their 
achievements. 
Senior leaders and our executive directors fully 
participate in the programmes, typically by giving 
recognition. Focus@bp 
At bp, focus@bp is our internal platform that 
helps support performance development. The 
platform enables employees to set dynamic 
goals, have regular check-ins, give and receive 
meaningful feedback and grow skills to enable 
our teams to develop and deliver.
We believe that performance matters, both 
individually and collectively, and development 
is key in helping to improve our performance as 
a business. 
focus@bp forms the basis of discussions 
relating to development or progression and is 
factored in when making decisions in relation to 
an individual’s remuneration.All-employee share plan
bp operates an award-winning global 
ShareMatch programme which is available 
to over 18,000 employees in 46 countries.
This plan offers our employees the opportunity 
to invest and share in bp’s success, fostering a 
culture of shared ownership. 
At the end of 2024, the participation rate in the 
scheme was 65% of eligible employees. Corporate governance

Workforce highlights in 2024 
Supporting employees during transformation 
Health and wellbeing 
Within the context of our ongoing organizational transformation, we have 
deepened our global wellbeing resources to help support our employees 
during this time. 
We have created new education modules for leaders to help support their 
teams through change, hosted sessions to help equip our people with tools 
to navigate change, worked collaboratively with our employee assistance 
programme partner to deepen their support resources including introducing 
a new product to offer proactive check-ins with a counsellor and offering a 
broad range of webinars and educational material. 
Fostering a high-performance and inclusive culture 
We remain focused on building a performance-based organization, that is 
representative of the world around us and an inclusive culture that creates 
a sense of belonging where people can perform at their best. 
As part of organizational transformation, we have embedded assurance 
processes within the selection process centred around promoting fairness 
and inclusivity for all. In addition, we have engaged with our business 
resource groups, using listening sessions and regular feedback channels to 
understand concerns and requests for support. Reward in our new businesses 
As we have acquired a number of new businesses – including 
TravelCenters of America in May 2023 and more recently Lightsource bp 
and bp bionergy in October 2024 – we have reviewed the reward framework 
of each new business on an individual basis. As part of these reviews, it is 
recognized that a universal approach may not meet the unique needs of the 
business. 
As part of this process, consideration is given to the local market and talent 
pool in which the new business predominately operates. For example, the 
acquisition of TravelCenters of America fundamentally changed our US 
footprint. The deal added a network of around 290 retail sites across the US 
and over 20,000 employees to bp’s population. Therefore, when reflecting 
on our reward offering the focus has been on simplification and aligning 
incentives with the US retail market. 
This differs from the approach taken at bp bioenergy, where the workforce 
consists of over 8,800 employees and 5,600 contractors across our 
operated mills in Brazil and the annual reward cycle is based on a March 
year-end in line with the local crop season. 
From a safety perspective, our intention is to embed bp’s safety culture, 
operating systems and practices across all our businesses. We 
acknowledge this can take time depending on the complexity of the newly 
acquired businessa.Directors’ remuneration report continued
94 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024a For recently acquired businesses, there is typically a transition period while bp’s operating standards, as set out in our Operating Management System «, are integrated or aligned.
Workforce engagement 
bp places particular importance on engaging 
with employees, recognizing that it is critical to 
have an engaged workforce to deliver our 
strategy.
We aim to have an open dialogue between the 
board, senior management and the wider 
workforce and encourage employees to share 
their views. For example, employees are kept 
regularly informed of matters of interest to 
them through bp's intranet, social media 
channels, town halls, site visits and webinars. 
During 2024, we continued to actively seek 
employee views through a variety of discussion 
groups. We held a number of employee-led 
forums and consulted our business resource 
groups, with a board-led session as part of the 
workforce engagement programme (WFEP) in 
May 2024 (see right). 
More detail on bp's WFEP can be found on 
page 78 .  
We have worked to develop a 
bp where our people can be 
themselves and work in a 
company that cares while 
also delivering results...                                                                                                                            
Employees at our Cherry Point refinery, US
Shareholder views 
We are committed to ongoing engagement with 
our shareholders. We believe it is important to 
meet regularly to understand their views on our 
remuneration arrangements and their evolving 
expectations. 
Feedback received frames our decisions on 
executive pay and other topics. Employee forum  
In May 2024 we held a WFEP session with 
selected employees from different locations 
across the globe.
The session was led by Dame Amanda Blanc, 
senior independent director, and Kerry 
Dryburgh, EVP people, culture & 
communications. 
The focus of the session was on performance, 
reward and employee engagement, with 
employees taking the opportunity to share 
their personal views and experiences of 
working at bp. 
In the session, individuals commented on the 
strong sense of culture at bp, referencing how 
our values are clearly present in day-to-day 
activities. The recent changes to reward, such 
as the introduction of a bonus uplift relating to 
individual performance, were also well received 
and considered motivational.
Key themes of the session were shared 
with the committee and have provided 
valuable insight.

Overview of single figure outcomes
Salary 
On 12 September 2023, Murray Auchincloss was appointed as CEO on an interim basis and his base pay was set at £1.45 million. This remained 
unchanged upon appointment to CEO on 17 January 2024. Kate Thomson was appointed CFO on 2 February 2024 and her base pay was set at £800,000. 
Given their recent appointments, neither executive director received an increase in respect of 2024 as part of the annual salary review. 
Benefits 
Executive directors received car-related benefits, coverage of tax return preparation, security assistance, insurance and medical cover. 
Murray Auchincloss’s taxable benefits materially decreased year-on-year due to the phasing out of transitional car-related benefits as reported in the 2023 
directors’ remuneration report.
Cash allowance in lieu of pension
In line with the 2023 directors’ remuneration policy, executive directors receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension of 20% of salary. This is in line with the 
wider workforce in the UK. Corporate governance

number on record and continues the downward trend seen in recent years. 
For tier 2 events, there was an increase compared to the same period last 
year, with 35 events in total for 2024 (30 in 2023).
Sustainability performance  was previously assessed against sustainable 
emissions reductions (SER). bp transitioned to use operated carbon 
emissions from 2024, as it is a more holistic and inclusive measure that 
represents the full breadth of possible operational movements and is better 
suited to driving ownership and delivery across the business. 
For 2024, operated carbon emissions of 33.7MtCO 2e achieved an outcome 
between target and maximum and is reflective of our strong progress 
against net zero operations milestones. The most significant reductions in 
the year came from flaring reductions and increased reliability in the 
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Türkiye region and efficient project start-ups. 
Emission reduction projects totalling 0.42MtCO 2e implemented by our 
business in 2024 included: our Gelsenkirchen refinery replaced imported 
steam from a coal-fired power plant with steam produced in our own gas-
fired boilers; bpx energy’s central distribution projects, Karnes and Bingo, 
which enabled decommissioning of legacy natural gas-driven equipment; 
and restoration of cooling water infrastructure at Cherry Point to reliably 
meet refinery needs and improve the efficiency of compressor operations. 
Further detail on safety and sustainability performance over the year is 
provided in the safety and sustainability committee (S&SC) report on  
page 80 .  
Reliability and availability  is a combined measure of bp-operated refining 
availability « and bp-operated plant reliability « with a performance outcome 
of 94.7% – achieving a nil outcome. Plant reliability strengthened year-on-
year to 95.2% (95.0% in 2023). However, refining availability was impacted 
by the Whiting power outage in Q1 2024 and was below threshold at 94.3%. 
Transition growth « engine adjusted EBITDA « (% growth) was introduced 
as a more holistic measure focused on transition growth engine financial 
delivery over the year. The measure is assessed based on annual growth 
against a 2023 baseline and has achieved a nil vesting outcome. This was 
primarily driven by lower than expected delivery in bioenergy, convenience 
and power trading. 
Financial performance, as measured by modified free cash flow « and 
adjusted EBITDA , was below target. bp generated modified free cash flow 
of $12.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $38.0 billion, which resulted in a nil 
outcome for both measures. Our targets are environment-adjusted at year- 
end and the revised targets for modified free cash flow and adjusted 
EBITDA were $14.7 billion and $40.9 billion respectively. 
Overall outcome 
The formulaic score for the 2024 annual bonus was 22.5% of maximum. 
The committee considered bp’s framework on fatalities when reflecting on 
the formulaic outcome. Sadly, there was one fatality during the year within 
our recently acquired biofuels business. Full details on the application of 
the framework have been provided on page 98 . 
Having considered the above, alongside a holistic review of performance, 
the committee determined that no discretion would be applied to the 
formulaic outcome for executive directors. Approach to deferral 
In relation to the policy on deferral requirements, the committee reviewed 
the executive directors’ shareholding during the year to assess if the 
minimum shareholding requirement had been met. 
As at 14 February 2025, the CEO’s shareholding represented 6.1x salary. 
This is above the minimum shareholding requirement for the CEO of 5x 
salary and his 2024 award will therefore be subject to a deferral rate of 
33%. While the CFO has made strong progress towards her minimum 
shareholding requirement since her appointment last year, her shareholding 
represented 2.6x salary on 14 February 2025. This is below her requirement 
of 4.5x of salary and her 2024 award will therefore be subject to a deferral 
rate of 50%. Corporate governance

bp's framework on fatalities  
We are  working towards our goal of eliminating 
workplace fatalities. We have implemented a new 
framework on fatalities. This framework, 
developed in consultation with shareholders and 
the safety and sustainability committee, links 
safety performance directly to the bonus 
scorecard.
Full details of our framework on fatalities can be found in the 
2023 directors’ remuneration report.

98 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024What happened during the year? How was the framework applied?
Our goal is eliminating fatalities, life-changing injuries and tier 1 
process safety events.  
Safety performance in 2024 
During the year, we made good progress in reducing the number of tier 
1 events with our lowest recorded number on record – continuing the 
downward trend we have seen in recent years. For tier 2 events, there 
was an increase compared to 2023.
This result is reflective of our efforts to improve process safety at bp. 
However, this positive performance was overshadowed by the sad 
news of a fatality in our newly acquired biofuels business (acquired on 
1 October 2024) during the year. The incident occurred in mid-October 
2024 in Brazil during maintenance activities. While there were no other 
fatalities during 2024, there were four life-changing injuries. We are 
taking action to learn from these incidents to help us make further 
improvements from a personal safety perspective. The committee consulted the framework in determining the impact of 
the individual fatality on the 2024 bonus outcome.  
Treatment of new assets
The framework allows for major acquisitions to be excluded for an 
initial period to enable the embedding of bp’s safety culture, operating 
systems and practices. 
While a fatality in an excluded new asset will not impact the group 
bonus score during this transition period, there will be consideration of 
safety performance within this business during the year – with any 
adjustments being made locally. 
Biofuels incident  
In September 2024, prior to the completion of the acquisition, the 
committee determined that the biofuels business should be excluded 
for three bonus performance years (i.e. up to the 2026 performance 
year) for bp employees. This is reflective of the complexity of the 
business, with over 8,800 employees and 5,600 contractors operating 
in 11 mills across Brazil.  
The acquisition completed on 1 October 2024. From this date, bp had 
direct operational accountability and was able to start the process of 
onboarding our Operating Management System (OMS) «. The fatality 
occurred mid-October and therefore within the exclusion period for the 
group scorecard. 
No adjustmentWhat was the outcome? 
In line with our framework, the committee determined that applying a discretionary adjustment to the formulaic 
outcome on group-wide bp staff for the fatality in the newly acquired biofuels business would not be appropriate. 
The incident is, however, expected to have a material impact on local bonus outcomes – with final determinations 
being made after the business’ year-end in March. resulting in a final bonus 
score of 22.5%  for executive 
directors.

Strategic progress
Overview of strategic progress (2022-24)
Performance of this measure has been challenging to assess as it spans a three-year period that has seen significant change. Our strategy has continued 
to evolve and update and the criteria we set back at the start of the performance period (2022) to judge progress do not fully reflect current expectations. 
Alongside assessment against three key pillars (established in 2022), the committee have also taken a broader review of the shareholder experience over 
the performance period. Further, there has been consideration of mid-cycle changes we have experienced during the performance period, such as bp’s 
updated transition strategy in February 2023 and the key strategic initiatives during 2024 which have laid our foundation for growth. In summary: 
•Resilient hydrocarbons:  Performed well across the board, with strong production delivery, plant reliability « and unit costs. This was offset by 
operational challenges during the period which primarily impacted refining availability «. Ultimately, financial performance was strong against this pillar. 
•Low carbon energy:  Progress was mixed with a number of key initiatives completed as management adapted to our evolving strategy and tough 
market conditions. 
•Convenience and mobility:  bp performed well across our suite of volume measures, but a very challenging market meant financial delivery was lower 
than expected. 
Overall performance:  During the period, bp has achieved a number of strategic milestones – particularly in the last year of the performance period – and is 
well positioned to drive future growth.
1. Deliver value through a resilient hydrocarbon business KPIs (as set in 2022)

Overview  
•Continued high grading of portfolio to drive higher margins. Completed joint venture conversions in Angola and Iraq, extended Indonesia 
production-sharing contract, completed 10 major projects and increased bpx production by 33%.
•Production on track with 2024 progress broadly on plan. 2022 and 2023 production were +2% vs. plan.
•The hydrocarbon business performed well against adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow measures – with actual performance ahead of 
expectations for both measures.
2. Demonstrate track record, scale and value in low carbon energy KPIs (as set in 2022) 
Developed renewables to FID « ò Improvement required
To the end of 2024, bp has delivered 8.2GW to FID (bp net). The main 
contributions have come from Lightsource bp and the 100% bp solar 
pipeline (Cygnus). The solar sector has been significantly impacted by 
increased interest rates, inflation and supply issues. Offshore wind has 
been materially impacted by supply chain inflation across all sub-sectors 
including turbines and vessels. 
While good progress has been made, 2025 targets were challenging and 
performance under this measure is tracking behind expectations.

Overview
•The low carbon energy pillar has materially transformed since the setting of targets in 2022. From a period of volume-driven origination, bp has 
moved into a stage of consolidation, portfolio reset and focus across all businesses within a more constrained capital frame.
•Low carbon energy delivered lower adjusted EBITDA than expected over the period. This was attributable to the challenging solar market in the US 
in 2023 and rapid ramp-up in hydrogen and offshore wind.Directors’ remuneration report continued

Overview
•Performance across the convenience and mobility pillar has been strong versus the targets we set at the beginning of 2022. However, market 
conditions have been challenging which has impacted financial delivery, leading to mixed performance.
•During the period, financial performance was impacted by cost inflation, challenging market environments and prolonged impact of COVID-19 on 
businesses such as Castrol . 
a 2023 excludes the acquisition of TravelCenters of America. The 2025 target represents the wider aim of achieving ~10% CAGR by 2030 (as set in 2023). 
b The Castrol  performance KPI was retired during the performance period and performance has therefore been considered ‘in the round’ including reference to earnings and volume growth.  
Overall assessment 
In progressing our strategic agenda, we have not only reviewed performance against the three strategic pillars of our previous strategy but also key 
strategic highlights, many of which culminated in the last year of the performance period, including:
Low carbon energy
•Completed transactions for 100% 
ownership of bp Bunge Bioenergia and 
Lightsource bp.
•New joint ventures including JERA Nex bp 
with JERA Co., Inc.
Resilient hydrocarbons
•Sanctioning 10 higher value major projects 
– including Kaskida and Tangguh UCC.
•Agreeing new access to resources in 
regions we know well, like the Middle East 
and India, where we are now technical 
services providers for the country’s largest 
offshore oil and gas field.
•Gas is now flowing at our Greater Tortue 
Ahmeyim (GTA) project off the coast of West Africa. Once fully commissioned, it is 
set to produce 2.4 million tonnes of LNG 
annually.
Convenience and mobility
•In 2024, Castrol grew underlying earnings by 
14% and has demonstrated six consecutive 
quarters of year-on-year underlying earnings 
growth. 
Financial
•Delivery of structural cost reductions of 
around $0.8 billion in 2024. This more than 
offsets significant increases from inflation, 
foreign exchange and costs associated with 
growing the business. Overall, we reduced 
our underlying operating expenditure by $300 million towards our target of $4-5 
billion of structural cost reductions by 
end-2027.
Resulting score 
Accounting for delivery (volume and value), 
bp’s evolving strategic context and the above 
strategic milestones, the committee 
determined performance against this measure 
should result in 66% of maximum vesting 
(2021-23: 75% of maximum). 
Strategic progress remains a key component 
of our long-term scorecard for outstanding 
awards and the committee will continue to 
apply judgement within the context of broader 
strategic delivery.
Other vesting considerations
Along with the results from the scorecard measures, the committee considers an ‘underpin’ to the formulaic outcome in order to determine the final 
vesting percentage. The underpin broadens our performance assessment, allowing us to consider vesting outcomes with overall alignment to absolute 
shareholder returns, environmental and safety factors and progress in matters relating to low carbon and climate change. Where relevant, we take input 
from the safety and sustainability committee and the audit committee to deepen and enhance our perspective.
Having considered the above, the committee concluded that the vesting outcome was suitably reflective of the company’s underlying performance and the 
experience of shareholders overall. The committee agreed it was not necessary to apply discretion to the formulaic outcome and approved vesting of 
66.5% for the 2022-24 EDIP award. This decision yields the outcome shown in the table below for the CEO. The scorecard detail is shown on page 99 .

Policy implementation for 2025 
The current remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the 2023 annual general meeting on 27 April 2023. The full policy is displayed on the 
company’s website at bp.com/remuneration . The table below shows how the remuneration policy will be implemented in 2025, alongside a summary of 
key features.
Salary To provide fixed remuneration to reflect the scale and complexity 
of both the business and the role, and to be competitive with the 
external market.
When setting salaries, the committee considers practice in other 
energy majors as well as European and US companies of a 
similar size, geographic spread and business dynamic to bp. 
Percentage increases for executive directors will not exceed that 
for the wider workforce, other than in specific circumstances 
identified by the committee (e.g. in response to a substantial 
change in responsibilities).
Salaries are normally set in the home currency of the executive 
director and are reviewed annually. They may be reviewed at 
other times where appropriate.•Murray Auchincloss's salary will increase by 4%, in line with 
the wider workforce, to £1,508,000 following the 2025 AGM. 
•Kate Thomson's salary will increase by 8% to £864,000 
following the 2025 AGM. This is to reflect her development 
in role and leadership for the Finance function since 
appointment in February 2024. 
•The budgeted increase to our UK salaried staff effective 
from 1 April 2025, our annual salary review date, will be 4%.
Pensions and 
benefitsExecutive directors normally participate in the company 
retirement plans that operate in their home country.
New appointees from within the bp group retain previously 
accrued benefits related to service prior to appointment as 
executive director. For their service as a director, cash allowance 
in lieu of pension will be up to 20% of base salary.
For future appointments, the committee will carefully review any 
retirement benefits to be granted to a new director, taking 
account of retirement policies across the wider group and any 
arrangements currently in place.•Murray and Kate’s cash allowance in lieu of pension is 20% 
of base pay (in line with the wider workforce).
•Prior to their appointment as executive directors, Murray 
received a US deferred pension and Kate received a UK 
deferred pension. No further pension is accrued under either 
plan.
•Benefits will remain unchanged for 2025 and include car-
related provisions, security assistance, insurance and 
medical cover.
Annual bonus Bonus is measured against an annual scorecard. The committee 
holds discretion to choose the specific measures and the relative 
weightings adopted in the annual scorecard, to reflect the annual 
plan as agreed with the board.
Numeric scales are set for each measure, to score outcomes 
relative to targets. A scorecard outcome of 1.0 reflects the target 
outcome and 2.0 is the maximum outcome.
Target bonus is 112.5% of salary, and maximum bonus is 225% 
of salary.
Half the bonus is paid in cash, and half is deferred into bp shares 
for three years up until the ’minimum shareholding requirement’ 
is met. At this point, 67% is paid in cash and 33% is paid in bp 
shares. Dividends (or equivalents, including the value of any 
reinvestment) may accrue in respect of any deferred shares.
Awards are subject to operationally robust and effective malus 
and clawback provisions as described below.•For 2025, our scorecard will be assessed against the 
following categories: safety and sustainability (30%) and 
financials and operations (70%).
•We intend to make the following changes to performance 
measures for 2025:
– Introduce a structural cost reduction measure that is 
aligned with our forward-looking commitments. This 
replaces the earnings measures in the scorecard.   
– Replace the measure focused on transition growth « 
engines with increased weighting on modified free cash 
flow« and bp-operated reliability « and availability «.  
•See page 104  for further details on measures for the 2025 
annual bonus.

Performance 
sharesPerformance shares are granted with a three-year performance 
period, measured against a scorecard.
The committee holds discretion to choose the specific measures 
and the relative weightings adopted in the scorecard, to ensure 
they are focused on the near-term priorities for delivering the bp 
strategy in the interests of shareholders.
Annual grants are 500% of salary for the CEO, and 450% of salary 
for any other executive director. Awards will vest in proportion to 
the outcomes measured through the performance scorecard, 
subject to any adjustment by the committee, and will be subject 
to a three-year post-vesting holding period. 
Awards are subject to operationally robust and effective malus 
and clawback provisions as described below.•For our 2025-27 cycle, the scorecard categories will remain 
unchanged from the 2024-26 cycle and will be assessed 
against the following: rTSR (25%), financials (40%), 
environmental, social and governance (15%) and strategic 
progress (20%). 
•The only change being made to the chosen performance 
measures for the 2025-27 cycle is the introduction of an 
adjusted free cash flow CAGR « measure. This replaces 
adjusted EBIDA CAGR per share «. All other measures are to 
remain the same. 
•See page 104 for further details on measures for the 
2025-27 EDIP. 
•The award will continue to be subject to an underpin 
that takes into consideration in-year safety outcomes 
and long-term trends in safety outcomes over the 
performance period.
•The 2025-27 awards will be granted based on the average 
closing share price of each calendar day in the 90-day 
period ending on the date of bp’s 2025 AGM.
Shareholding 
requirementCEO to build a shareholding of at least five times salary, and other 
executive directors four and a half times salary, within five years 
of appointment.
Executive directors are required to maintain that level for at least 
two years post-employment.•Murray’s shareholding has reached 6.1 times salary, above 
his minimum shareholding requirement of 5 times of salary.
•Kate’s shareholding has reached 2.6 times salary. Over the 
next four years, to 2029, Kate will work towards reaching her 
minimum shareholding requirement of 4.5 times of salary.
Malus and 
clawbackOperationally robust and effective malus and clawback provisions apply to our incentive awards.
Malus provisions may be applied where there is: a material safety or environmental failure; an incorrect award outcome due to 
miscalculation or incorrect information; a restatement due to financial reporting failure or misstatement of audited results; material 
misconduct; or other exceptional circumstances that the committee considers similar in nature.
Clawback provisions may apply where there is: an incorrect outcome due to miscalculation or incorrect information; a restatement 
due to financial reporting failure or misstatement of audited results; or material misconduct.
Committee 
flexibilityThe committee has discretion to adjust performance measures and weightings, and to revise the peer group for the rTSR measure.
This discretion allows appropriate realignment, throughout the policy term, for changes in the annual plan and for the anticipated 
evolution of the low carbon business environment.
The committee also holds discretion in determining the outcomes for annual bonus and performance shares, allowing them 
to take broad views on alignment with shareholder experience, environmental, societal and other relevant considerations

Measures for the 2025 annual bonus
Provided below is a summary of the performance measures we have chosen for the 2025 annual bonus plan scorecard. The targets are commercially sensitive and 
will be disclosed in the 2025 directors’ remuneration report. 
We are replacing our earnings (adjusted EBITDA «) measure with structural cost reductions « to better align with the financial priorities set out in the Capital Markets 
Update announcement in February 2025. This measure will be assessed against a 2023 baseline and is positioned to capture sustainable cost reductions that can 
be maintained beyond 2027.
In line with our reset strategy, the measure on transition growth « engines has been removed from the scorecard for 2025. In the interest of simplification, the 
committee determined that the scorecard should be kept to five measures. The weighting of modified free cash flow « and bp-operated reliability « and availability « 
will be increased – from 25% to 30% and 10% to 15% respectively. This change mirrors our focus on cash generation and driving strong operations for 2025. 
Importantly, the framework on fatalities will continue to apply to the 2025 annual bonus and will be considered at year-end if a fatality occurs during the year.

Measures for the 2025-27 performance shares (EDIP) 
Provided below is a summary of the measures we have chosen for the 2025-27 performance share plan. The four categories remain unchanged from the prior year 
and there has been no change to respective weightings. 
Under our financials category, we are proposing to introduce an adjusted free cash flow CAGR measure (20% weight) and to modify the ROACE measure to align 
with our strategic commitments. The committee reflected on the dual focus of free cash flow in the short and long-term incentive scorecards and determined it was 
appropriate given our strategic focus on cash generation – with adjusted free cash flow being a primary target in bp’s reset strategy. The two cash measures; 
modified free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow CAGR are different, with the former covering a holistic view of in-year cash generation (including working capital 
and proceeds) and the latter representing underlying free cash flow growth, removing more volatile items, in line with our external targets. The ROACE measure now 
fully aligns with our external targets with measurement at the end of 2027.
For strategic progress, the measure will remain subject to the committee’s judgement at the end of the three-year period. The judgement of performance will take 
into account progress against the financial targets set under our reset strategy – including reference to measures such as divestments, net debt « and structural 
cost reductions. This will be alongside our holistic review of progress against our strategy, to ensure that outcomes are aligned with the shareholder experience.

Stewardship and executive director interests
We believe that our executive directors should build and maintain a material interest in the company. Our policy therefore requires the CEO and CFO to 
build a personal shareholding of five times and four and a half times, respectively, their salary within five years of their appointment. They are expected to 
maintain this level of personal shareholdings for two years post-employment.
Directors’ shareholdings and aggregated interests (audited)
The table below details the personal shareholdings of each executive director. These figures include all beneficial and non-beneficial ownership of shares 
of bp (or calculated equivalents) that have been disclosed to the company. Murray Auchincloss has met the minimum shareholding requirement (MSR) 
under the policy. Kate Thomson is expected to satisfy the policy requirement that applies five years from her date of appointment, 2 February 2024. The 
committee has reviewed and confirmed this position and will continue to monitor compliance with this policy.

Executive directors have additional interests in performance and deferred bonus shares. These interests are shown in aggregate in the table above, and 
interests awarded during 2024 in the tables below. For performance shares, the figures reflect maximum possible vesting levels (excluding the addition of 
reinvested dividends) even though the actual number of shares that vest will depend on the extent to which performance conditions are satisfied.

a The face value of awards granted during 2024 have been calculated using a market price of ordinary shares at close on the date of award, as follows: £5.04 on 7 May 2024. In calculating the number of 
ordinary shares over which these awards were made, the committee applied the average price of ordinary shares over the 90 calendar days up to and including the annual general meeting that was held 
on 25 April 2024 (£4.89). 
b Performance conditions are measured 15% on cumulative reduction % in operated carbon emissions, 25% on TSR relative to Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, TotalEnergies, Eni, Equinor and Repsol over three 
years, 20% ROACE averaged over the performance period, 20% adjusted EBIDA per share CAGR measured vs. year ended June 2020 and 20% strategic progress assessed over the performance period. 
Minimum vesting under this award (below threshold performance) is 0%. At threshold performance, vesting would be 6.25% of maximum. 
Since 2010, vesting of the performance shares under EDIP has been subject to a safety underpin. If the committee assesses that there has been a material deterioration in safety performance, or there 
have been major incidents, either of which reveal underlying weaknesses in safety management, then it may conclude that shares should vest only in part, or not at all. In reaching its conclusion, the 
committee obtains advice from the S&SC.
The performance period is 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2026. 
The 2025 performance share awards under EDIP are expected to be made following the conclusion of the 2025 annual general meeting. 
c There is no identified minimum vesting threshold level. The 2024 bonus year deferred share awards under EDIP are expected to be made following the conclusion of the 2025 annual general meeting. 
Directors and leadership team
No directors or other leadership team members own more than 1% of the shares in issue. At 14 February 2025, our directors and leadership team 
members collectively held interests of 6,288,180 ordinary shares or their calculated equivalents, 4,339,104 restricted share units (with or without 
conditions) or their calculated equivalents, 7,399,346 performance shares or their calculated equivalents and 6,174,714 options over ordinary shares or

Chair and non-executive director outcomes and interests
Fee structure
The table below shows the fee structure for the chair and non-executive directors (NEDs). The chair is not eligible for committee chairship and 
membership fees. The senior independent director (SID) is eligible for committee chairship and membership fees, and their fee includes the board member 
fee. Committee chairs do not receive a membership fee for the committee they chair. 
Under the 2023 policy, fee levels are reviewed annually alongside wider workforce salaries and any changes are put into effect from 1 April. Taking all 
factors into consideration, for 2025 the board agreed to implement a 4% increase to the base fee for NEDs and for the SID, aligned with the salary increase 
budget for the UK wider workforce. Determination of the fees payable to the chair falls to the remuneration committee, which agreed to align the 
percentage increase of the chair's fee with the other NEDs. Following board and remuneration committee approval, the remuneration arrangements for the 
chair and NEDs will be adjusted with effect from 1 April 2025.

a Bob Dudley’s pay has been converted from US dollars as per the ratios reported in the  bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2020 .
b For 2023, the total single figure used to derive the CEO pay ratio is a combination of the two individuals in position of CEO during the year. In respect of the former CEO, the calculation has been based on 
the total single figure excluding the impact of malus and clawback in order to provide a comparison with prior years. Appropriate pro-rating of fixed and variable pay has been applied.
c Share price for the CEO share plan vesting has been based on the average share price over Q4 of the 2024 FY of £3.90.
This is our sixth year reporting the CEO pay ratio following the requirements introduced in 2018. As per the past five years, we have selected Option A as 
our reporting basis, being the most accurate approach available, and we confirm that no broadly applicable components of pay have been omitted. Where 
necessary, full-time equivalent pay has been calculated by simple engrossment of part-year values. Employee values relate to pay and benefits for the year 
ended 31 December 2024.
Changes in the pay ratio over time reflect the fact that CEO remuneration is more heavily weighted to variable pay, resulting in larger year-on-year swings 
than wider workforce pay. This is evidenced by the variability of the CEO pay ratio over the past six years. This volatility in the pay ratio reporting from year 
to year is expected, and illustrates one of the challenges in commenting on whether the pay differentials are appropriate. In 2024, the 50th percentile pay 
ratio decreased from 103:1 to 74:1. This was largely driven by the outcomes of the CEO’s variable awards, with the lowest bonus outcome in the past 10 
years (excluding nil bonus for 2020) and the performance share award being granted at a lower multiple of salary when he was in position as CFO. 
The committee believes in performance-based remuneration. For all employees eligible to participate in the annual cash bonus plan, there is an individual 
uplift available each year which allows managers to nominate individuals based on their personal contributions during the year. For senior leaders, a 
significant portion of the remuneration package continues to be linked to performance-based reward. It is therefore the view of the committee that the 
remuneration frameworks we have in place for executive directors and the wider workforce are fit-for-purpose and deliver pay outcomes appropriate to the 
circumstances of the year, with differentials that reflect the relative contributions made at different levels of the organization. 
The committee is satisfied that the median pay ratio reported this year is consistent with bp’s pay policies for employees and does not constitute a reason 
to modify our pay programmes.
Percentage change comparisons: directors’ remuneration versus employees
In the table below, values in column ‘a’ represent the percentage change in salary and fees; values in column ‘b’ represent the percentage change in taxable 
benefits; and values in column ‘c’ represent the percentage change in bonus outcomes for performance periods in respect of each financial year. For the 
purposes of comparison, the employee percentages shown below represent the relative change between the median full-time equivalent pay for every 
employee employed at BP p.l.c. at any point during the relevant financial year, and the equivalent median value for the preceding financial year. Where 
increases are infinite relative to the preceding year, we have shown them as 100% for illustration, where a director was appointed or retired part-way 
through the year we have annualized pay except for one-time items, and where comparison to the prior year is not possible we have used dashes.

Independence and advice
The board considers all committee members to be independent with no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the committee’s 
decisions. Further detail on the activities of the committee in 2024 is set out in the remuneration committee report on  page 88 . 
During 2024 Ben Mathews, who was employed by the company and reported to the chair of the board, acted as secretary to the remuneration committee. 
The committee also received advice on various matters relating to the remuneration of executive directors and senior management from Kerry Dryburgh, 
EVP people, culture & communications and Ashok Pillai, SVP reward. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) continued to provide independent advice to the committee in 2024. PwC advice included, for example, support with 
remuneration benchmarking and updates on market practice. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consulting Group and, as such, operates under the 
code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration in the UK. The committee is satisfied that the advice received is objective and independent. The 
committee is comfortable that the PwC engagement partner and team who provide remuneration advice to the committee do not have connections with 
the company or its directors that may impair their independence. 
Total fees or other charges (based on an hourly rate) for the provision of remuneration advice to the committee in 2024 (save in respect of legal advice) 
were £88,751 to PwC. Freshfields LLP (Freshfields) provided legal advice on specific compliance matters to the committee. PwC and Freshfields provide 
other advice in their respective areas to the group. 
Considerations related to the UK Corporate Governance Code
When setting the 2023 policy, the committee concluded that a scorecard-based approach to setting targets and measuring outcomes helps it to engage 
transparently with shareholders and the wider workforce on remuneration. Thus, bp continues to operate a simple, clear structure of market-aligned salary 
with annual and three-year performance-based incentives. Risks are managed through careful setting of performance measures and targets and the 
committee retains the exercise of its discretion in assessing outcomes. These are complemented with robust malus and clawback measures. 
Remuneration outcomes are predictable, as shown in the implementation charts of the 2023 policy, and proportional by virtue of the challenging 
performance levels required to achieve target pay outcomes. Through material weighting in measures related to safety, sustainability and strategy, as 
shown on page 104 , remuneration aligns closely with bp’s culture, as expressed through our purpose and ambition. 
Shareholder engagement
Throughout 2024 the committee engaged frequently on remuneration policy and approach with bp’s largest shareholders, as well as their representative 
bodies. This dialogue will continue throughout 2025. The table below shows the recent votes on the directors’ remuneration report and policy.
Year % vote ‘for’ % vote ‘against’ Votes withheld

2023 – Directors’ remuneration policy  94.23%  5.77% 36,921,641
Service contracts and letters of appointment
The service contracts of executive directors do not have a fixed term. Service contracts for each executive director are available for shareholders to view 
upon request at the company’s registered office. Each executive director’s service contract contains a 12-month notice period. Consistent with the best 
interests of the group, the committee will seek to minimize termination payments.

The non-executive directors (NEDs) have letters of appointment, which are available for shareholders to view upon request at the company’s registered 
office. All directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the annual general meeting. Normally, NEDs will be encouraged to serve for up to 
nine years from their appointment in line with the provisions of the 2018 Code, subject to annual re-election. 
External appointments
The board supports executive directors taking up appointments outside the company to broaden their knowledge and experience. Each executive director 
is permitted to retain any fee from their external appointments. Such external appointments are subject to agreement by the chair and reported to the 
board. Any external appointment must not conflict with a director’s duties and commitments to bp. Details of appointments as NEDs of publicly listed 
companies during 2024 are shown below.

Appointment and succession plans
The chair, senior independent director (SID) and 
other independent non-executive directors (NEDs) 
each have letters of appointment with BP p.l.c. and 
do not serve, nor are they employed, in any 
executive capacity by bp. In line with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (Code), bp proposes all 
directors for annual re-election by shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting (AGM), where letters of 
appointment for each NED are available for 
inspection. Details on the skills and experience of 
each director seeking election or re-election, as well 
as their individual contributions to the long-term 
success of the company, are set out in the Notice of 
AGM. In accordance with the Code, NEDs would not 
be expected to serve beyond nine years unless there 
are exceptional circumstances. On behalf of the 
board, the people, culture and governance 
committee reviews the formal appointment process 
and succession plans for the board. Appointments 
and succession plans are both based on merit and 
assessed against objective criteria with the 
promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion as 
central considerations. This includes diversity of 
gender, social and ethnic backgrounds as well as 
cognitive and personal strengths. In reviewing 
appointments and succession plans, 
due consideration is given to ensure the smooth 
transition of board members with specific 
responsibilities (e.g. committee chair roles) by 
allowing sufficient time for a detailed handover. 
This is balanced by the need to have new board 
members join at regular intervals such that over 
time there is a controlled approach to board 
members reaching the end of their tenure. All new 
directors receive a formal induction, tailored to their 
individual needs, skills and experience, taking 
account of any committees they join. These 
inductions include one-to-one meetings with 
members of the board and leadership team 
together with select members of senior 
management. Feedback is sought from directors 
undertaking their induction programmes to  ensure 
they are continually updated and  improved. 
Further detail on board succession and tenure can 
be found in the people, culture and governance 
committee report on page 87  and board at a glance 
disclosure on page 71, respectively.Time commitments 
The expectation regarding time commitment for 
NEDs to effectively discharge their duties is set out 
in the directors’ letters of appointment. The time 
commitment varies with the demands of bp 
business and other events. The NEDs’ external time 
commitments – whether through executive, non-
executive, advisory or other roles – are regularly 
reviewed by the company secretary to ensure that 
directors are able to allocate appropriate time to bp. 
A register of directors’ time commitments and 
conflicts is maintained and is also reviewed annually 
by the people, culture and governance committee. 
The review process takes into account outside 
appointments and other external commitments and 
considers the complexity of the organization, the 
nature of the role, the sector (especially regulated 
and/or potentially competing sectors) and any 
leadership roles (e.g. a chair position). NEDs are also 
required to consult with the company secretary and 
chair before accepting any other role that may 
impact their ability to commit appropriate time to 
bp. The process for the approval of any new 
external appointment, significant or otherwise, for 
an existing director assesses the impact of that 
appointment on the director’s time in order to 
ensure the director has sufficient capacity for their 
role with bp. As part of that same review process, a 
review of independence and potential conflicts of 
interest is undertaken, taking account of institutional 
investor and proxy advisor guidance and market 
best practice. Any external proposed commitments 
that could exceed the mandates set out in such 
guidance are given particular consideration. The 
board was satisfied that significant appointments 
undertaken during 2024 did not impact the 
directors’ ability to prepare for and attend meetings, 
engage with stakeholders and participate in learning 
and development opportunities. The board has 
concluded that, notwithstanding external 
appointments held, each director is able to dedicate 
sufficient time to fulfil their bp duties. In compliance 
with the Code, none of the executive directors who 
served during 2024 held more than one non-
executive directorship in a FTSE 100 company or 
other significant appointment throughout their 
tenure on the board. For more information on the 
external commitments of bp’s directors, see pages 
72-73 .For information on board meetings held during 
2024 and director attendance at board meetings, 
see page 71 . 
Independence and conflicts 
of interest
All directors have a statutory duty to exercise 
independent judgement. Independence of NEDs 
is crucial in bringing constructive challenge to the 
chief executive officer (CEO) and the leadership 
team at board meetings, while providing support 
and guidance to promote meaningful discussion 
and, ultimately, informed and effective decision-
making. In accordance with the criteria set out in 
the Code, the chair was considered independent 
at the time he was appointed. NEDs are required 
to provide sufficient information to allow the 
board to evaluate their independence prior to and 
following their appointment. In addition, each 
director has a statutory duty to disclose actual or 
potential conflicts of interest. Formal procedures 
are in place for new potential conflicts to be 
reported and recorded during the year. As a 
consequence of regular reviews in 2024, the 
board is satisfied that there were no matters 
giving rise to conflicts of interest which could not 
be authorized by the board. It has therefore 
concluded that all bp NEDs are independent.

Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the 
annual report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
The directors are required by the Companies Act 
2006 to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year that give a true and fair view of the 
financial position of the group and the parent 
company and the financial performance and 
cash flows of the group and parent company for 
that period. Under that law they are required to 
prepare the consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
United Kingdom and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and United Kingdom accounting 
standards (United Kingdom generally accepted 
accounting practice), including FRS 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. In preparing 
the consolidated financial statements the 
directors have also elected to comply with IFRS 
as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) and IFRS as adopted by 
the European Union (EU).
In preparing those financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
•Select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently.
•Make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent.
•Present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and understandable 
information.
•Provide additional disclosure when 
compliance with the specific requirements 
of IFRS is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions 
on the group’s financial position and 
financial performance. 
•State that applicable accounting standards 
have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the 
parent company financial statements.
•Prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the company will continue 
in business.The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the group and company and enable 
them to ensure that the consolidated financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and the parent company financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the group and company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Having made the requisite enquiries, so far as the 
directors are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (as defined by Section 418(3) of the 
Companies Act 2006) of which the company’s 
auditors are unaware, and the directors have 
taken all the steps they ought to have taken to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the company’s 
auditors are aware of that information. 
Each of the current directors, whose names and 
functions are listed on pages 72-73 , confirms 
that to the best of their knowledge:
•The consolidated financial statements, 
prepared on the basis of IFRS as issued by 
the IASB, IFRS as adopted by the United 
Kingdom and EU and in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 as 
applicable to companies reporting under 
international accounting standards, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of 
the group.
•The parent company financial statements, 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
generally accepted accounting practice, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position, performance and cash 
flows of the company.
•The management report, which is 
incorporated in the strategic report and 
directors’ report, includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
business and the position of the group, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.
Helge Lund
Chair
6 March 2025UK Corporate Governance Code 
compliance
Throughout 2024 bp applied the principles of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (Code) and 
has complied with all the provisions. The 
information set out in the directors’ report, 
including the committee reports on pages 
80-110 , is intended to provide an explanation of 
how bp applied the principles and complied with 
the provisions of the Code during the year. The 
Code can be found on the Financial Reporting 
Council website: frc.org.uk.
Risk management and internal control
Under the Code, the board is responsible for the 
company’s risk management and internal control 
systems. In discharging this responsibility the 
board, through its governance principles, requires 
the chief executive officer to operate the 
company with a comprehensive system of 
controls and internal audit and to identify and 
manage the risks, including emerging risks, that 
are material to bp. In turn, the board, through its 
monitoring processes, satisfies itself that these 
material risks are identified and understood by 
management and that systems of risk 
management and internal control are in place to 
mitigate them. These systems are reviewed 
periodically by the board, have been in place for 
the year under review and up to the date of this 
report and are consistent with the requirements 
of Principle O of the Code.
The board has processes in place to:
•Assess the principal and emerging risks 
facing the company.
•Monitor the company’s system of internal 
control (which includes the ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
principal and emerging risks).
•Review the effectiveness of that system 
annually.
Acquired businesses which have not transitioned 
into bp’s system of internal control and non-
operated joint ventures and associates « have 
not been dealt with as part of this process.
A description of the principal risks facing the 
company, including those that could potentially 
threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity, is set out in risk factors on 
pages 65-67. During 2024 the board undertook a 
robust assessment of the principal and emerging 
risks facing the company. The principal means 
by which these risks are managed or mitigated 
are set out on pages 61-64 .Directors’ statements
112 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

In assessing the risks faced by the company and 
monitoring the system of internal control, the 
board and the audit and safety and sustainability 
committees requested, received and reviewed 
reports from executive management, including 
management of the business segments, 
corporate activities and any functions, at their 
regular meetings. A report by each of these 
committees, including its activities during the 
year, is set out on  pages 80-85 .
During 2024 the committees, as relevant, also 
met with management, the SVP internal audit 
and other monitoring and assurance functions 
(including group ethics & compliance, safety and 
operational risk, group control, group legal and 
group risk) and the external auditor. Responses 
by management to incidents that occurred were 
considered by the relevant committee or the 
board, as appropriate.
At a meeting in March 2025, the audit committee 
considered reports from the group risk function 
on the system of internal control and the 
function’s categorization of significant failings or 
weaknesses. The audit committee also 
considered a report from internal audit on their 
assessment of bp’s systems of internal control 
and risk management, based on audit work 
conducted during 2024. In considering these 
reports and assessments, the audit committee 
noted that bp’s systems of internal control and 
risk management are designed to manage, rather 
than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The board then considered the review 
undertaken by the audit committee and the 
proposed disclosures outlining the company’s 
risk management and internal control 
systems prior to publication of the annual 
report and accounts.
A statement regarding the company’s internal 
controls over financial reporting is set out on 
page 336.Longer-term viability
In accordance with provision 31 of the Code, the 
directors have assessed bp’s prospects both at 
an operating and strategic level with some 
business planning processes extending out 
beyond the next ten years. However, the directors 
believe that a viability assessment period of three 
years remains appropriate given the nature of our 
business and exposure to short-term commodity 
pricing. This assessment is based on 
management’s reasonable expectations of the 
position and performance of the company over 
this period, its internal detailed budgets and 
planning timeframes and the targets and aims 
that it has set out.
Our risk management system, described in how 
we manage risk starting on page 61 , outlines our 
risk identification, assessment and management 
approach for all risks, including our principal 
risks, described starting on page 65 .
Taking into account the company’s current 
position and its principal risks, the directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the company 
will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the next 
three years.
The directors’ assessment included a review of 
the potential financial impact of, and the financial 
headroom that could be available in the event of, 
the most severe but plausible scenarios that 
could threaten the viability of the company. The 
assessment took into consideration the robust 
financial position of the group and the potential 
mitigations that management reasonably believes 
would be available to the company over this 
period. Mitigations considered include use of 
cash, access to debt facilities and credit lines, 
raising of capital, reductions in capital 
expenditure, divestments and dividend reductions.
The scenarios that have been modelled are 
based on the most severe but plausible 
outcomes and associated costs are based on 
actual experience where possible. The scenarios 
link to one or more of our principal risks 
described on pages 65-67  and have been 
considered individually and as a cluster of 
events. They include:
•A significant process safety incident when 
operating facilities, drilling wells or 
transporting hydrocarbons. Process safety, 
personal safety and environmental risks, see  
page 67 .
•A sustained significant decline in oil prices 
over three years.  Prices and markets, see  
page 65 .
•A significant cyber security incident. Digital 
infrastructure, cyber security and data 
protection, see  page 66 .
•A loss of a significant market or producing 
asset for six months. Prices and markets, see 
page 65 .As an example of a cluster of events, bp models 
a risk scenario involving a significant process 
safety incident (when operating facilities, drilling 
wells or transporting hydrocarbons) during a low-
price environment (i.e. where there is a sustained 
significant decline in oil prices over a three-year 
period). 
The directors also considered the impact on 
viability from an extended pandemic scenario, as 
well as the potential risks associated with 
climate change and the transition to a lower 
carbon economy. They consider that the most 
likely impacts of these risks are broadly captured 
and modelled through the sustained low oil price 
and loss of a producing asset scenarios.
In assessing the prospects of the company, the 
directors noted that such assessment is subject 
to a degree of uncertainty that can be expected 
to increase looking out over time and, 
accordingly, that future outcomes cannot be 
guaranteed or predicted with certainty.
Fair, balanced and understandable 
The board considers the annual report and 
financial statements, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
Going concern
In accordance with provision 30 of the Code, the 
directors consider it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements.
Forecast liquidity has been assessed under a 
number of stressed scenarios to support this 
assertion. Reverse stress tests performed 
indicated that the group will continue to operate 
as a going concern for at least 12 months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements 
even if the Brent price fell to zero. For further 
information on financial risk factors, including 
liquidity risk, see Financial statements – Note 29 .Corporate governance

We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services provided to the group and parent company for the 
year are disclosed in Note 36 to the financial statements. 
We confirm that we have not provided any non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard to the group or the parent company, with the 
exception of Deloitte UAE providing an additional service of rolling forward a BP p.l.c.’s subsidiary’s financial statements. The service was administrative in 
nature and there were no calculations or judgements applied when carrying out this exercise. In our opinion, based on no fees being charged for the 
services and the size of the component, the impact of providing the services was immaterial and inconsequential, however this is a breach, albeit 
insignificant, of the Ethical Standard. Following investigation, we have concluded in agreement with the Audit Committee that given the size of the services 
provided and their potential impact, as well as the safeguards in place, our objectivity and impartiality has not been impaired, and we believe that a 
reasonable and informed third party with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that we are capable of exercising objective 
and impartial judgement on all matters related to the audit. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

3. Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
•potential impact of climate change and the energy transition
•impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets
•decommissioning provisions
•valuation of commodity financial derivatives, where fraud risks may arise in revenue recognition, and
•management override of controls.
In the current year, we re-considered whether the accounting for complex transactions remains a key audit matter. While the 
group continues to enter into such transactions, these transactions have significantly reduced in magnitude compared with the 
prior year. Consequently, accounting for these transactions was not included as a key audit matter, as they do not have a material 
impact on the group's financial statements. We designed and performed audit procedures relative to the risk levels determined 
through the application of our consistent framework for evaluating complex transactions. These procedures were adjusted, as 
necessary, based on the nature, scale, and complexity of the transactions assessed during the year.
All other key audit matters are consistent with those we identified in the prior year and the developments in fact patterns of these 
previously identified key audit matters are explained in the respective sections below. 
Materiality The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was $800 million (2023 $1,000 million) which was determined 
based on cash flow from operations and underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax.
We adopted a different basis to determine materiality used to audit the group financial statements this year due to the impact of 
changing macroeconomic conditions, one-off transactions and strategic decisions on the group’s profit before tax. In the prior 
year we determined materiality based on profit before tax and underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax.
Scoping Our scope covered 178 consolidation units (cons units). Of these, 153 were subject to audits of specified account balances and 25 
were subject to specified audit procedures by the component audit teams or group audit team. These covered 69% of revenue, 
73% of PP&E and 72% of profit before tax. The remaining 765 cons units were subject to other procedures, including performing 
analytical reviews, making inquiries of management, and evaluating and testing management's group-wide controls. 
4. Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is appropriate.
Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
included:
•assessing the financing facilities including the nature of the facilities and repayment terms;
•assessing whether the impact of potential margin calls in respect of derivative exchange contracts used to risk manage the physical portfolio has been 
appropriately considered given price volatility; 
•assessing management’s identified potential mitigating actions and the appropriateness of the inclusion of these in the going concern assessment; 
•testing the clerical accuracy of the going concern model;
•assessing the historical accuracy of forecasts prepared by management;
•performing our independent sensitivity analysis; and
•assessing the disclosures made within the financial statements.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, 
may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when 
the financial statements are authorised for issue.
In relation to the reporting on how the group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.
5. Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current 
year and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included 
those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Throughout the course of our audit, we identify risks of material misstatement (‘risks’). We consider both the likelihood of a risk and the potential 
magnitude of a misstatement in making the assessment. Certain risks are classified as ‘significant’ or ‘higher’ depending on their severity. The category of 
the risk determines the level of evidence we seek in providing assurance that the associated financial statement item is not materially misstated.
The matters described below were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.Financial statements

5.1 Potential impact of climate change and the energy transition (impacting PP&E, goodwill, intangible assets and provisions) – Notes 
1, 4, 12, 14, 15 and 33 to the financial statements
Key audit matter description Climate change impacts bp’s business in a number of ways as set out in the strategic report on pages 1-68 of the Annual 
Report and Note 1 of the financial statements on page 145. It represents a strategic challenge and a key focus of 
management. The related risks that we have assessed for our audit are as follows:
•Forecast assumptions used in assessing the value-in-use of oil and gas PP&E assets within bp’s balance sheet for 
impairment testing, particularly oil and gas price assumptions and their interrelationship with forecast emissions costs, 
may not appropriately reflect changes in supply and demand due to climate change and the energy transition (see 
‘Impairment of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets’ below).
•The timing of expected future decommissioning expenditures in respect of oil and gas assets may need to be brought 
forward with a resulting increase in the present value of the associated liabilities due to the impact of climate change. 
In addition, there is an exposure to decommissioning obligations that may revert back to bp in respect of assets 
transferred to third parties through historical divestments. The risk of exposure is increased due to the impacts of 
climate change which have heightened long term financial resilience concerns for many industry participants. 
Furthermore, provisions for decommissioning refining assets, not generally recognised on the basis that the potential 
obligations cannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates, might need to be recognised if reductions 
in demand due to climate change curtail their operational lives (see ‘Decommissioning provisions’ below).
•The recoverability of certain of the group’s $4.4 billion total exploration and appraisal (E&A) assets capitalised as at 31 
December 2024 (2023 $4.3 billion) is potentially exposed to climate change and the global energy transition risk factors 
(see Note 15). This is because a greater number of E&A projects may not proceed as a consequence of the energy 
transition or lower forecast future oil and gas prices. The determination of whether and when E&A costs should be 
written off, impaired, or retained on the balance sheet as E&A assets, remains complex and continues to require 
significant management judgement.
•The useful economic lives of the group’s refining assets may be shortened as society moves towards ‘net zero’ 
emissions targets and bp seeks to achieve its net zero ambition, such that the depreciation charge is materially 
understated. Of the total refining assets carried in the balance sheet, all but an immaterial residual value relating 
primarily to land and buildings will be fully depreciated by 2050. As disclosed in Note 1 to the accounts on page 146, 
management has concluded that demand for refined products is expected to remain sufficient for the existing 
refineries to continue operating for the duration of their remaining useful lives and hence no changes to the useful 
economic lives of its refinery assets were required. 
•The carrying value of bp’s refining assets within PP&E may no longer be recoverable, due to changes in supply and 
demand which arise among other things as a consequence of climate change and the energy transition. Management 
identified impairment indicators in respect of the Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany during the year and, as a result, an 
impairment test was performed to assess the recoverability of the Gelsenkirchen refinery carrying value. As disclosed 
in Note 4 to the accounts on page 166 management has recorded an impairment charge of $0.8 billion (2023 $1.3 
billion) in respect of the Gelsenkirchen refinery, primarily driven by changes in economic assumptions.  At 31 December 
2024 management identified an impairment indicator for all of its other refineries due to a reduction in the local marker 
margins. The impairment tests performed by management to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of these 
refineries did not result in any additional impairment charges being recognised. 
•The total goodwill balance as at 31 December 2024 is $14.9 billion (2023 $12.5 billion), of which $7.2 billion relates to 
upstream oil and gas assets (2023 $7.0 billion). The carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable as a 
consequence of climate change and therefore may need to be impaired. For oil production & operations (‘OP&O’) and 
gas & low carbon energy (‘G&LCE’), goodwill is allocated to hydrocarbon CGUs in aggregate at the respective segment 
level.  Goodwill related to low carbon energy investments is held separately within the G&LCE segment. The most 
significant assumption in the hydrocarbon related goodwill impairment tests affected by climate change relates to 
future oil and gas prices (see ‘Impairment of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets’ below). Given the significant level of 
headroom in the goodwill impairment tests, management identified no other assumption that could lead to a material 
misstatement of goodwill due to the energy transition and other climate change factors. Disclosures in relation to 
sensitivities for goodwill are included within Note 14 on page 179. The customers & products (C&P) segment has a 
goodwill balance of $5.5 billion (2023 $5.4 billion), of which the most significant element is $2.6 billion relating to the 
Castrol business (2023 $2.7 billion). Notwithstanding the expected global transition to electric vehicles which may 
reduce demand for lubricants, due to the substantial headroom in the most recent impairment test (as described in 
Note 14), management has assessed as remote the likelihood that the recoverable amount of goodwill is less than its 
carrying value. 
•Climate change-related litigation brought against bp, as disclosed in Note 33 to the financial statements, may lead to 
an outflow of funds requiring provision.
Subsequent to the year end, on 26 February 2025 the group announced a strategy reset, with a consequent impact on the 
group’s key targets and metrics for 2025 and beyond.  This post balance sheet event has been considered by 
management in the context of forecasts and assumptions as they relate to the 2024 financial statements and the matters 
noted above. 
The above considerations were a significant focus of management during the period which led to this being a matter that 
we communicated to the audit committee, and which had a significant effect on the overall audit strategy. We therefore 
identified this as a key audit matter. This matter was also discussed by the Audit Committee on page 84.

How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matterOverall response 
We held discussions with management, with our Climate Change specialists and within the group engagement team to 
identify the areas where we felt climate change could have a potential impact on the financial statements.
We also continued to utilise a climate change steering committee comprising a group of senior partners and specialists 
with specific climate change and technical audit and accounting expertise within Deloitte to provide an independent 
challenge to our key decisions and conclusions with respect to this area.
Audit procedures 
The audit response related to two of the audit risks identified is set out under the key audit matters for ‘Impairment of 
upstream oil and gas PP&E assets’ on pages 121-123 and ‘Decommissioning provisions’ on pages 124-125. Other 
procedures are as follows:
In respect of the recoverability of E&A assets capitalised as at 31 December 2024:
•We tested the relevant controls within the group’s E&A write-off and impairment assessment processes. 
•We challenged and evaluated management’s key E&A judgements with regards to the impairment criteria of IFRS 6. 
Where impairment indicators were identified, we corroborated key judgements with internal and external evidence for 
assets that remained on the balance sheet. This included analysing evidence of future E&A plans, budgets and capital 
allocation decisions, assessing management’s key accounting judgement papers, reading meeting minutes and 
assessing licence documentation and evidence of active dialogue with partners and regulators including negotiations 
to renew licences or modify key terms.
We challenged management’s assertion that no changes are required to the assessed useful economic lives of refining 
assets as a consequence of climate change factors. In doing this, we obtained third party reports assessing future refined 
petroleum product demand for those countries which are included in our group full audit scope for the C&P segment. In 
particular, we considered the forecasts as set out in the IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 which shows that demand for 
refined petroleum products is expected to remain sufficient for at least the current remaining useful economic lives of the 
refineries such that current depreciation rates are appropriate, including under the Announced Pledges Scenario which is 
associated with a temperature rise of 1.7 °C in 2100 (with a 50% probability). 
We considered the impact of potential changes in supply and demand on the group’s refining portfolio and assessed 
internal and external market studies of future supply and demand. In relation to the refinery impairment tests performed 
by management, our audit procedures included: evaluating the valuation methodology and testing the integrity and 
mechanical accuracy of the impairment models; assessing the appropriateness of key assumptions and inputs to the 
impairment models, notably forecast local refining marker margins, discount rate and energy input costs, challenging and 
evaluating management’s assumptions by reference to third party data where available and involvement of our valuation 
specialists; and evaluating management’s ability to forecast future cash flows and margins by comparing actual results 
with historical forecasts and tested management’s internal controls over the impairment test and related inputs.  
We performed procedures to satisfy ourselves that, other than future oil and gas price assumptions, there were no other 
assumptions in management’s oil and gas goodwill impairment tests in respect of which reasonably possible changes 
due to the energy transition and other climate change factors could cause goodwill to be materially misstated. We 
assessed the impact of climate change on C&P segment activities and we have not noted any factors to indicate 
impairment of goodwill due to climate change. 
With regard to climate change litigation, we designed procedures specifically to respond to the risks that provisions could 
be understated or that contingent liability disclosures may be omitted or be inaccurate including:
•holding discussions with the group general counsel and other senior bp lawyers regarding climate change matters; 
•conducting a search for climate change litigation and claims brought against the group; 
•making written inquiries of, and holding discussions with, external legal counsel advising bp in relation to climate 
change litigation; and
•assessing the contingent liability disclosures in the annual report on pages 217-219.
With regard to the consideration of the impact of the post balance sheet strategic announcement by the group, we 
performed procedures to assess the reasonableness and completeness of management’s analysis as to the impact on 
forecasts and assumptions underpinning the judgements identified above.
We read the other information included in the Annual Report and considered (a) whether there was any material 
inconsistency between the other information and the financial statements; and (b) whether there was any material 
inconsistency between the other information and our understanding of the business based on audit evidence obtained and 
conclusions reached in the audit.Financial statements

Key observations Key observations in relation to oil and gas price assumptions used in oil and gas PP&E asset impairment tests, and the 
impact of climate change on decommissioning provisions are set out in the relevant key audit matter below.
We concluded that the key E&A assessments had been appropriately determined and the judgements management had 
made were appropriately supported. We did not identify any additional impairments or write-offs from the work we 
performed.  
We are satisfied: 
•with the results of our procedures relating to the carrying value of refining assets and that the impairments recorded 
are reasonable;
•with the results of our procedures relating to the assessment of the useful economic lives of refining assets and 
therefore depreciation charges, based on the market studies we read;
•with the sensitivity analysis disclosures around the energy transition and other climate change factors performed in 
respect of the goodwill balances, and that the group’s goodwill balances are not materially misstated;
•with management’s assertion that no provision should currently be made in respect of climate change litigation. Based 
on the audit evidence obtained both from internal and external legal counsel, we concluded that management’s 
disclosure of the contingent liabilities in respect of these matters is appropriate; 
•that management’s assessment of the impact of the group’s post balance sheet strategy update on the forecasts and 
assumptions as they relate to the judgements are reasonable and complete; and 
•that management’s other disclosures in the Annual Report relating to climate change are consistent with the financial 
statements and our understanding of the business. 
Whilst many of bp’s oil and gas properties and refining assets are long term in nature, by 2050, the remaining carrying 
value of assets currently being depreciated will be immaterial, this date being the target set by the majority of 
governments with ‘net zero’ emissions targets and also by bp, with its sustainability aims of ‘net zero operations’ and ‘net 
zero sales’. At current rates of depreciation, depletion and amortisation (‘DD&A’), the average remaining depreciable life of 
the upstream oil and gas PP&E (within the OP&O and G&LCE segments) is five years and the refining assets (within the 
C&P segment) is eleven years.

5.2 Impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets – Notes 1, 4 and 12 to the financial statements
Key audit matter description The group balance sheet as at 31 December 2024 includes PP&E of $100 billion (2023 $105 billion), of which $56 billion 
(2023 $62 billion) is oil and gas properties.  
Management’s best estimate oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment tests were revised in 2024 as set 
out in Note 1 on page 152, although the revisions were not significant.  
Management has also determined bp’s ‘best estimate’ discount rate assumptions, as set out in Note 1 on page 152. bp’s 
post-tax discount rate used for impairment testing for oil and gas assets in 2024 remained unchanged from prior year at 
8% (2023: 8%). Pre-tax discount rates applied in impairment tests were revised in some regions to reflect changes in local 
tax rates and country risk premiums, however the impact of these revisions was insignificant. Reserves estimates for all 
oil and gas fields were also reviewed and updated where necessary at year-end.
Management judged that in aggregate, the year-end oil and gas price assumption revisions, changes to pre-tax discount 
rates for certain regions due to country risk premium or tax rate changes, and changes to other input assumptions 
including reserves reductions on several key fields, all combined to constitute an impairment trigger for all oil and gas 
cash generating units (CGUs). As a result of testing performed during 2024, $2.0 billion (2023 $3.6 billion) of oil and gas 
CGU net impairment charges were recognised, principally due to certain discount rate revisions, an increase in certain 
capital expenditure forecasts and operating expenditure forecasts and certain reserves write downs.    
We identified three key management estimates in management’s determination of the level of impairment charge and/or 
impairment reversal. These are:
Oil and gas prices – bp’s oil and gas price assumptions have a significant impact on many CGU impairment 
assessments performed across the OP&O and G&LCE segments and are inherently uncertain. The estimation of 
future prices is subject to increased uncertainty given climate change, the global energy transition, macro-
economic factors and disruption in global supply due to ongoing geo-political conflicts. There is a risk that 
management do not forecast reasonable ‘best estimate’ oil and gas price forecasts when assessing CGUs for 
impairment charge and/or impairment reversal, leading to material misstatements. These price assumptions 
are highly judgmental and are pervasive inputs to bp’s oil and gas CGU valuation. There is also a risk that 
management’s oil and gas price related disclosures are not reasonable.
bp's oil and gas price assumptions for value-in use impairment assessments are aligned with bp’s investment 
appraisal assumptions, except that potential future emissions costs that could be borne by bp are included in 
investment appraisals as bp costs without assuming incremental revenue. 
As described in Note 1 on page 146, emissions costs forecasts interrelate with bp’s oil and gas prices, because 
bp’s price assumptions for value-in-use estimates represent ‘net producer prices’, i.e., net of any further 
emissions costs that may be enacted in the future.  Management’s judgement is that the potential impact of 
such further emissions costs being borne by producers including bp is not expected to have a material impact 
on bp’s oil and gas CGU carrying values as costs would effectively be borne by oil and gas end users via overall 
higher commodity prices.  There is a risk that management’s judgement is not reasonable.
Discount rates  – Given the long timeframes involved, certain CGU impairment assessments are sensitive to the 
discount rate applied. Discount rates should reflect the return required by the market and the risks inherent in 
the cash flows being discounted. There is a risk that management does not assume reasonable discount rates, 
adjusted as applicable for country risks and relevant tax rates, leading to material misstatements. Determining a 
reasonable discount rate is highly judgmental and, consistent with price assumptions above, the discount rate 
assumption is also a pervasive input across bp’s oil and gas CGU valuations, before adjustments for asset 
specific risks and tax rates. 
Reserves and resources estimates  – A key input to certain CGU impairment assessments is the oil and gas 
production forecast, which is based on underlying reserves estimates and field specific development 
assumptions. Certain CGU production forecasts include specific risk adjusted resource volumes, in addition to 
proven and/or probable reserves estimates, that are inherently less certain than reserves; and assumptions 
related to these volumes can be particularly judgemental. There is a risk that material misstatements could arise 
from unreasonable production forecasts for individually material CGUs and/or from the aggregation of 
systematic flaws in bp’s reserves and resources estimation policies across the OP&O and G&LCE segments. 
We identified certain individual CGUs with a total carrying value of $9 billion (2023 $18 billion) which we determined would 
be most at risk of material impairment charges as a result of a reasonably possible change in the oil and gas price 
assumptions. These CGUs have been subjected to $9 billion worth of previous impairments and as such, are also at risk of 
material impairment reversal resulting from potential oil and gas price assumption changes. We identified that a subset of 
these CGUs was also individually materially sensitive to the discount rate assumption. Accordingly, we identified these as 
significant audit risks.
We also identified CGUs with a further $2 billion (2023 $2 billion) of combined carrying value which were less sensitive. We 
identified these as a higher audit risk as they would be potentially at risk, in aggregate, to a material impairment by a 
reasonably possible change in some or all of the key assumptions.  No impairment reversals are available for these CGUs. 
Further information regarding these sensitivities is given in Note 1 on page 153.
Impairment charge and/or impairment reversal assessments of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets remain a key audit 
matter because recoverable values are reliant on forecast assumptions such as oil and gas prices, discount rates and 
reserves estimates, which are inherently judgemental and complex for management to estimate and challenging to audit.  
Additionally, the magnitude of the potential misstatement risk remains material to the group. This matter was discussed 
by the Audit Committee on page 85.Financial statements

How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matterWe tested relevant internal controls over the estimation of oil and gas prices, discount rates, and reserve and resources 
estimates, as well as relevant internal controls over the performance of the impairment charge and/or impairment reversal 
assessments where we identified audit risks. In addition, we conducted the following substantive procedures.  
Oil and gas prices   
•We independently developed a reasonable range of forecasts based on external data obtained, against which we 
compared management’s oil and gas price assumptions in order to challenge whether they are reasonable.  
•In developing this range, we obtained a variety of reputable and reliable third party forecasts, peer information and 
other relevant market data. 
•In challenging and evaluating management’s price assumptions, we considered the extent to which they and each of 
the forecast pricing scenarios obtained from third parties reflect the impact of lower oil and gas demand due to climate 
change and the energy transition.   
•The 2015 Conference of the Parties (CoP) 21 Paris Agreement goals of ‘holding the increase in the global average 
temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 
1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’ was reaffirmed at CoP 29 in Baku during November 2024. We specifically analysed 
third party forecasts stated, or interpreted by us, as being consistent with scenarios achieving the Paris ‘well below 2°C 
goal’ and/or ‘1.5°C ambition’ and evaluated whether they presented contradictory audit evidence.  
•We challenged and evaluated management’s judgement, described in Note 1 on page 146, that the potential impact of 
further emission costs being borne by producers including bp is not expected to have a material impact on bp’s oil and 
gas CGU carrying values. We obtained evidence supporting that oil and gas price forecasts included in our reasonable 
range are forecast on a ‘net producer prices’ basis, (i.e., net of potential future emissions costs that are assumed to be 
borne by oil and gas end users), consistent with the basis of bp’s value-in-use price assumptions.   
•We assessed management’s disclosures in Note 1, including the sensitivity of forecast revenue cash inflows to lower 
oil and gas prices and how climate change and the energy transition, potential future emissions costs and/or reduced 
demand scenarios may impact bp to a greater extent than currently anticipated in bp’s value-in-use estimates for oil 
and gas CGUs. 
Discount rates 
•We independently evaluated bp’s discount rates used in impairment tests with input from our valuation specialists, 
against relevant third party market and peer data.  
•When performing procedures over specific assets, we assessed whether specific country risks and tax adjustments 
were reasonably reflected in bp’s discount rates. 
• We challenged and evaluated management’s disclosures in Note 1, including in relation to the sensitivity of discount 
rate assumptions. 
Reserves and resources estimates 
With the assistance of our oil and gas reserves specialists we:  
•assessed bp’s reserves and resources estimation methods and policies for reasonableness;   
•assessed how these policies had been applied to a sample of bp’s reserves and resources estimates which included 
those that we judged to represent the greatest risk of material misstatement; 
•read and evaluated a sample of reports provided by management’s external reserves experts and assessed the scope 
of work and findings of these third parties;  
•assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of bp’s internal and external reserve experts, through 
understanding their relevant professional qualifications and experience;  
•assessed whether management’s production forecasts are consistent overall with bp’s strategy; 
•compared the production forecasts used in the impairment tests with management’s approved reserves and resources 
estimates; and  
•performed a retrospective assessment in order to assess management's ability to accurately estimate reserves and 
resources and to check for indications of estimation bias over time.

Key observations Oil and gas prices
For the purpose of PP&E impairment tests, management is required under IAS 36 to apply its current ‘best estimate’ of 
future oil and gas prices. We determined that bp’s ‘best estimate’ assumptions are reasonable when compared against a 
range of third party forecasts and peer information that we identified as being appropriate for this purpose. In forming this 
view, we included each forecaster’s ‘base case’, ‘central case’ or ‘most likely’ estimate.
We further observed that, as well as publishing a ‘base case’, ‘central case’ or ‘most likely’ estimate, certain third party price 
forecasters including the IEA published other price forecasts including some that were stated as, or were interpreted by us 
as being, Paris ‘well below 2°C goal’ or Paris ‘1.5°C ambition’ scenarios. We observed that none of those third party 
forecasters described their ‘Paris consistent’ scenarios as their ‘base case’, ‘central case’ or ‘most likely’ estimate. 
Management notes on page 145 that they consider their ‘best estimate’ prices to be in line with a range of transition paths 
consistent with the Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C as well as the ambition to limit global 
warming to no greater than 1.5°C. We observed that for bp’s Brent price assumptions, whilst these were within the lower 
half of our range of ‘best estimate’ forecasts described above, they were within the higher half of our range of Paris ‘well 
below 2°C goal’ and ‘1.5°C ambition’ scenarios. For Henry Hub gas, management’s updated gas price assumptions sit 
towards the top of our range until 2040 and then towards the middle until 2050. The positioning of bp’s revised oil and gas 
forecasts within the range is broadly consistent with bp’s positioning in the prior period range. We also noted other 
reputable third party sources that set out or implied even higher prices under both Paris ‘well below 2°C goal’ and ‘1.5°C 
ambition’ scenarios, highlighting the large inherent uncertainty regarding ‘Paris consistent’ pathways and the very wide 
range of potential price forecasts. Accordingly, we consider management’s statement as set out above to be reasonable.
By inquiry and analysis, we confirmed that the third party oil and gas price forecasts used to develop our independent 
range are on a net producer price basis. Accordingly, we are satisfied management’s judgement is reasonable that the 
potential impact of further emission costs being borne by bp is not expected to have a material impact on the group’s oil 
and gas CGU carrying values. 
We reviewed the disclosures included in Note 1 to the accounts in respect of oil and gas price assumptions, including the 
sensitivity analysis presented therein. We observed that management’s downside sensitivity, in which oil and gas prices 
are lower than the ‘best estimate’ in all future periods, is close to the bottom end of our range of third party Paris ‘well 
below 2°C goal’ and Paris ‘1.5°C ambition’ scenarios for both Brent oil and Henry Hub gas.

bp’s post-tax nominal 8% discount rate used for impairment testing for oil and gas assets, was within the independent 
range calculated by our valuation specialists. 
We were also satisfied with the calculation of country risk premia. Accordingly, we are satisfied with the discount rates 
used in the impairment charge and impairment reversal testing.
Reserves and resources
We assessed the production forecasts used in the oil and gas CGU valuations that we tested to be reasonable and 
appropriately risked where applicable, for the purposes of management’s impairment tests. We observed that in 
aggregate, management’s production forecasts, as utilised in year-end oil and gas CGU impairment testing, are aligned 
with bp’s best estimate of the future production of their existing oil and gas portfolio.  Financial statements

5.3 Decommissioning provisions – Note 1 and 23 to the financial statements
Key audit matter description A decommissioning provision of $11.8 billion is recorded in the financial statements as at 31 December 2024 (2023 $12.4 
billion). The estimation of decommissioning provisions is a highly judgemental area as it involves a number of key 
estimates related to the cost and timing of decommissioning, in particular inflation and discount rate assumptions.  
Management estimates that the average rate of forecast inflation applicable to the substantial majority of bp’s 
decommissioning cost estimates is 1.5%, which is 0.5% lower than its estimated long term general inflation rate of 2%. 
The extent to which average future decommissioning cost inflation will differ from the general inflation rate depends on 
industry demand and supply of rigs and other relevant services at the time future decommissioning occurs, which in turn 
will be influenced by future oil and gas demand, and increasingly by structural changes in the industry supply chain driven 
by the energy transition, which are uncertain. 
The estimated undiscounted cost of the obligations and the timing of future payments are set out in Note 1 on page 159. 
Economic factors, future activities and the legislative environments that bp operates in are used to inform cost estimates, 
whereas the timing of decommissioning activities is dependent on cessation of production (CoP) dates, which are 
sensitive to changes in bp’s price forecasts as price estimates determine economic cut off of oil and gas reserve 
estimates.
bp increased the discount rate used in calculating its decommissioning provisions from 4.0% as at 31 December 2023 to 
4.5% as at 31 December 2024. The increase was primarily driven by increased US treasury bond rates.
Additionally, bp is exposed to decommissioning obligations that could revert back to the group in respect of historical 
divestments to third parties. Judgement is required to assess the potential risk of reversion and if applicable, the 
estimated exposure, for each historically divested asset. The risk of reversion could be elevated by the potential impact of 
the energy transition, in particular the potential for lower oil and gas prices in the longer term which could result in financial 
resilience concerns for some industry participants. 
Provisions for decommissioning refining assets, not generally recognised on the basis that the potential obligations 
cannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates, might need to be recognised if reductions in demand due 
to climate change curtail their operational lives. As disclosed in Note 1 on page 159 management concluded that, although 
obligations may arise if refineries cease manufacturing operations, they would only be recognised at the point when 
sufficient information became available to determine potential settlement dates. Accordingly, other than where a decision 
has been made to cease refining operations, no triggers for assessing the need to record a decommissioning provision 
have been identified. 
This matter was discussed by the Audit Committee on page 85.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matterLong-term inflation rate
•We tested the relevant control related to the determination of the decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption.
•We tested how management derived the decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption of 1.5%, and the evidence 
on which it is based, by gaining an understanding of the process used by management, testing management’s 
calculations of the assumption, and evaluating the evidence relevant to management’s assumption, both supporting 
and contradictory.
•As the 1.5% decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption is determined by making an adjustment to 
management’s 2.0% general long term inflation rate assumption, we evaluated the general long term inflation rate 
assumption used of 2.0%, comparing it against latest external market data.
•We made inquiries and evaluated the competence, capability and objectivity of management’s decommissioning 
experts who derived the decommissioning specific inflation rate.
•We inspected analyst forecasts and reports in respect of the future decommissioning market and related costs for 
evidence of supporting and contradictory evidence, with particular focus on the future rig market.
•We particularly considered the expectation that demand for oil and gas products and related activities will decrease, 
primarily in response to climate change and energy transition effects pivoting future energy industry investment and 
development activity towards renewable sources. We challenged and evaluated management’s assessment of the 
impact this will have on the decommissioning market and the related inflation assumption.
•We analysed historical trends of rig market rates against oil prices and historical inflation to evaluate management’s 
assumption that the decommissioning inflation assumption does not inflate at the same rate as general inflation.

124 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

Cost and timing estimates
•We tested the relevant controls over the year end decommissioning cost and timing assumptions used within 
management’s decommissioning provision estimate.
•We assessed the completeness and accuracy of the assets subject to decommissioning, including understanding the 
process to establish whether a legal or constructive obligation existed.
•We evaluated the reasonableness of changes in key cost assumptions including rig rates, vessel rates, well plug and 
abandonment duration and non-productive time assumptions, with reference to internal and appropriate third party 
data. 
•We assessed changes in assumptions for the estimated date of decommissioning and evaluated whether CoP dates 
used for decommissioning estimation are aligned with CoP assumptions in other areas, including PP&E impairment 
testing and oil and gas reserve estimation.
•We assessed the accuracy of bp’s disclosure of the estimated undiscounted cost of its obligations and the timing of 
future decommissioning payments.
Discount rates
•We tested the relevant controls related to the determination of the discount rate assumption.
•We assessed the reasonableness of management’s methodology for determining the discount rate and recalculated 
the discount rate with reference to independent third party data, most notably US treasury bond yields. 
Reversion risk
•We obtained an understanding of bp’s decommissioning reversion risk assessment process and tested relevant 
internal controls including those controls over the completeness and accuracy of the previously divested asset data.
•We challenged and evaluated management’s key judgements related to the decommissioning reversion risk and 
conclusions as to whether any additional provision should be recognised, or specific contingent liability disclosure 
made. We assessed the relevant internal and external evidence used in forming this judgement, including the financial 
health of the counterparty or counterparties in the ownership chain for the divested assets and the existence of any 
other pertinent factors which could indicate a higher probability of decommissioning obligations reverting to bp.
Potential decommissioning of refinery assets
•We challenged and evaluated management’s analysis which supported the judgement that no decommissioning 
provisions should be recognised in respect of refineries where there is ongoing activity and management has no 
current intention to cease these activities.  
•We have reviewed analysis undertaken by management, as well as third-party studies, of forecast demand for refined 
products in regions served by bp’s refineries. Furthermore, we read external profitability benchmarking to assess the 
conclusion that the group’s remaining refineries would likely remain operational for longer than many of their regional 
competitors, in the event of refining capacity reductions. 
•We also met with refinery management to understand the potential plans under consideration for refineries in the 
future and obtained evidence that management is developing plans for the existing refinery sites remaining in the 
portfolio which would be compatible with net zero emissions, for instance through the production of alternative low 
carbon and sustainable fuels.
Key observations We concluded that the assumed inflation rate of 1.5% remains reasonable as a long-term inflation rate for 
decommissioning liabilities. With respect to the extent to which average future decommissioning cost inflation will differ 
from the general inflation rate, which is influenced by the demand and supply of rigs and other relevant services at the 
time future decommissioning occurs, we concluded that market forecasts support the assertion that demand for rigs will 
not increase in the long term as a result of the impact of the energy transition and therefore that inflation of rig costs will 
be limited.
We concluded that the cost and timing assumptions used in the decommissioning provision calculation were reasonable 
and the assumptions are appropriately supported by industry data. The disclosure included on page 159 with respect to 
the estimated undiscounted cost of bp’s decommissioning obligations and the timing of future decommissioning 
payments are consistent with these conclusions.
Based on our audit procedures, we consider bp’s 4.5% discount rate to be reasonable.
No material additional decommissioning provisions have been made in respect of historical divestments where bp are 
exposed to decommissioning reversion risk as a result of the potential future bankruptcy of the current asset owner. 
Based on our review and challenge of management’s assessment, we consider this judgement to be reasonable. We also 
consider the contingent liability disclosure to be reasonable. 
In respect of the group’s refining assets, taking into consideration both the IEA demand forecasts and management’s 
strategic plans for the group’s refineries, including developing production of low carbon and sustainable fuels, we are 
satisfied that it is not currently possible for management to determine closure dates for the remaining operational 
refineries or estimate reliably a settlement date for any decommissioning obligations prior to a decision being made to 
cease refining operations. Accordingly, we have not identified any triggers that would require a decommissioning provision 
to be recorded. Financial statements

5.4 Valuation of commodity financial derivatives, where fraud risks may arise in revenue recognition – Notes 1, 29 and 30 to the 
financial statements
Key audit matter description bp’s supply, trading and shipping (ST&S) function is responsible for globally trading and risk managing the group’s owned 
as well as third party production. To discharge this responsibility, ST&S regularly executes commodity contracts, 
physically settled or otherwise, which are accounted for as a derivative and fair valued under IFRS 9. These contracts, 
therefore, result in unrealised gains/losses that are recognised on account of fair value movements in the associated 
derivative assets and liabilities. 
Determining the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities can be complex and subjective, particularly where the 
valuation is dependent on significant inputs which are not observable and are classified as level 3 in the fair value 
hierarchy set out in IFRS 13.  This degree of subjectivity also makes such fair value estimates liable to potential fraud by 
management incorporating bias in the inputs used in determining fair values. Given the significant judgements, sensitivity 
to management assumptions, and the absolute value associated with these positions, we have identified a significant risk 
in respect of certain financial instruments where the valuation is dependent on significant unobservable inputs. 
Fair value measurements associated with unrealised commodity contracts are also impacted by the macroeconomic 
sentiment and outlook. In 2024, commodity markets continued to experience periods of volatility due to continuing 
uncertainty resulting from the planned energy transition, macro-economic factors such as inflation and interest rates, and 
disruptions in global supply due to geopolitical conflicts. In response to the volatility observed, we focused our audit 
efforts on the valuation of commodity derivatives and designed procedures to test for management bias. 
As at 31 December 2024, the group’s total level 3 derivative financial assets were $16.0 billion (2023 $9.2 billion) and level 
3 derivative financial liabilities were $14.4 billion (2023 $7.1 billion).
This matter was discussed by the Audit Committee on page 85.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matterIn response to the above, we analysed the population of these instruments to assess the level of unobservability of the 
inputs used in their valuation and then further disaggregated the population into different risk populations which in turn 
drove the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures.  
To address the complexities associated with auditing the valuation of instruments dependent on significant unobservable 
inputs, we included valuation specialists with significant quantitative and modelling expertise to assist in performing our 
audit procedures. Our valuation audit work included the following control and substantive procedures:
• We tested the group’s valuation relevant controls including:
– the model certification control, which is designed to review a model’s theoretical soundness and the 
appropriateness of its valuation methodology; and
– the independent price verification control, which is designed to review the appropriateness of valuation inputs 
that are not observable and are significant to the financial instrument’s valuation.
• We performed valuation testing procedures at interim and year-end balance sheet dates, including:
– evaluating management’s valuation methodologies against standard valuation practice and analysing whether a 
consistent framework is applied across the business period over period; 
– engaging our valuation specialists to challenge models, develop fair value estimates and evaluate consistency 
in management’s modelling and input assumptions throughout the year;
– comparing management’s input assumptions against the expected assumptions of other market participants 
and observable market data;
– independently validating price points on pricing curves; and
– analysing whether there was any indication of management bias through evaluating the distribution of valuation 
differences where relevant.
Key observations Based on the evaluation of the results of the procedures noted above, we concluded that management’s valuations 
relating to commodity derivatives were appropriate and we did not identify evidence of management bias in the valuation 
estimates or accounting entries that we tested.

5.5 Management override of controls (potentially impacting all financial statement accounts)
Key audit matter description We conducted an assessment of the fraud risks arising from management override of controls by considering potential 
areas where the group’s financial statements could be manipulated. In performing this assessment, we considered 
pressures or incentives to achieve certain measures due to the remuneration arrangements of people in Financial 
Reporting Oversight Roles (FRORs), including management and senior executives, as well as other incentives which could 
exist in light of bp’s share buyback commitments communicated to its shareholders.
Our considerations included the potential for:
•inappropriate accounting estimates and judgements
•the posting of fictitious or fraudulent journal entries or
•inappropriate accounting for significant transactions that are outside the normal course of business for the entity.
Management has enhanced its control environment in 2024 to address deficiencies identified during prior period audits. 
During the year, certain deficiencies had yet to be remediated but we have identified mitigating controls to address the risk 
associated with the deficiencies. These included analytical reviews, controls over closing balances, period-end analytical 
review controls and certain automated business controls. 
This area had a significant bearing again this year on the allocation of audit resources and has been discussed with the 
audit committee throughout the year. Accordingly, we identified this as a key audit matter.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matterWe tested the mitigating controls to respond to the risk of fraudulent journal entries. In addition, we:
• made inquiries of individuals with different levels of responsibility involved in the financial reporting process about 
inappropriate or unusual activity relating to the processing of journal entries and other adjustments;
•identified and tested relevant entity-level controls, in particular those related to the bp Code of Conduct, whistleblowing 
(bp OpenTalk) and controls monitoring financial reporting processes and financial results;
•made inquiries of management and others within bp as appropriate, who deal with allegations, if any, of fraud raised by 
employees or other parties; 
•used our data analytics tools to select journal entries and other adjustments made at the end of a reporting period, or 
otherwise having characteristics associated with common fraud schemes, for testing; and
•tested journal entries and other adjustments recorded in the general ledger throughout the period, with a particular 
focus on adjustments that occur late in the financial close process.
We assessed accounting estimates for bias. A number of the most significant estimates are covered by the other key 
audit matters set out above. This assessment included:
•evaluating whether the judgements and decisions made by management in making the accounting estimates included 
in the financial statements, even if they are individually reasonable, indicate a possible bias on the part of bp's 
management that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud; and
•performing a retrospective analysis of management judgements and assumptions related to significant accounting 
estimates reflected in the financial statements of the prior year.
We considered whether there were any significant transactions that are outside the normal course of business, or that 
otherwise appear to be unusual due to their nature, timing or size.  
The risks and responses to the revenue recognition risk within the supply, trading and shipping function are set out on 
page 126.
Key observations We were able to rely on the mitigating controls tested.
Our testing of journal entries and other adjustments, selected through the use of our data analytics tools, did not identify 
any inappropriate items. 
We did not identify evidence of overall bias or any significant transactions that are outside the normal course of business 
for which the business rationale (or the lack thereof) of the transaction suggested that it may have been entered into to 
engage in fraudulent financial reporting or to conceal misappropriation of assets.Financial statements

6. Our application of materiality
6.1 Materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our 
work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Materiality In 2024 we set materiality for both the group and parent company at $800 million.
In 2023, we used a materiality of $1,000 million for both the group and parent company. The decrease in materiality is due to 
the downturn in the group’s performance compared with prior year. 
Basis for determining 
materialityChanging macroeconomic conditions, one-off transactions 
and strategic decisions had a significant impact on the 
group’s profit before tax in 2024.  We therefore determined 
that it is appropriate to use the benchmarks of most 
relevance to investors, being cash flow from operations and 
underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax.  
Materiality was determined to be $800 million, which is 2.9% 
of cash flow from operations (2023 3.1%) and 3.9% of 
underlying replacement cost profit before tax (2023 3.7%). In 
2023, we determined materiality to be $1,000 million, which 
represented 4.2% of profit before tax and 3.7% of underlying 
replacement cost profit before tax.We determined materiality for our audit of the standalone 
parent using 0.6% (2023 0.8%) of net assets. 
Rationale for the 
benchmark appliedWe conducted an assessment of which line items are the 
most important to investors and analysts by reading analyst 
reports and bp's communications to shareholders and 
lenders, as well as the communications of peer companies. 
Based on our review of analysts’ reports, all analysts 
identified one or more cashflow metrics as a key operating 
metric, particularly net cash flow from operations. Also, 
based on our assessment of the latest results announcement 
Q&As, the focus of the investors has been on cash flow 
generation and the strength of the balance sheet, particularly 
from a net debt perspective given the current underlying 
performance of the group. We therefore focused on cash 
flow from operations in our determination of materiality for 
the current year.
We further note that the alternative performance measure 
underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax is 
one of the key metrics communicated by management in 
bp's results announcements and therefore is considered to 
be an appropriate benchmark.The materiality determined for the standalone parent 
company is based on net assets as the company is non-
trading and operates primarily as a holding company.  We 
believe the net asset position is the most appropriate 
benchmark to use.

We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and undetected misstatements 
exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole. 
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Performance materiality Group and parent company performance materiality was set at 65% of materiality for the 2024 audit (2023 65% of 
materiality).
Basis and rationale for 
determining performance 
materialityConsistent with the prior year, performance materiality of 65% reflects the overall quality of the control environment, the 
magnitude of misstatements identified in the current and prior years, as well as the fact that management is generally willing 
to correct any such misstatements.
6.3 Error reporting threshold
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the committee all audit differences in excess of $40 million (2023 $50 million), as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the audit committee on disclosure matters 
that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
7. An overview of the scope of our audit
7.1 Identification and scoping of components
As a result of the highly disaggregated nature of the group, with operations in over 60 countries through approximately 940 cons units, a significant portion 
of our audit planning effort was so that the scope of our work was appropriate in addressing the identified risks of material misstatement. 
The factors that we considered when assessing the scope of the bp audit, and the level of work to be performed included the following:
•The determination of significance of an account balance and risks of material misstatement related to it, history of unusual or complex transactions, 
identification of significant audit issues or the potential for, or a history of, material misstatements.
•The effectiveness of the control environment and monitoring activities, including entity-level controls.
•The findings, observations and audit differences that we noted as a result of our 2023 audit engagement.
Our audit approach was generally to place reliance on management’s controls over financial reporting.Financial statements
This page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.
bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 129

For the current year, components have either been subject to audits of one or more classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures, or specific 
further audit procedures. 
As a result, to be able to obtain sufficient, appropriate audit evidence for the purposes of our audit of the financial statements, the group engagement team 
and component teams performed audits of specified account balances in 153 reporting cons units covering UK, US, Australia, Azerbaijan, Germany, 
Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritania & Senegal, Indonesia, Egypt, India and Abu Dhabi. 
In 2023, we performed full scope audits for 138 reporting cons units which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. Our full-scope audits 
were in the UK, US, Australia, Azerbaijan and Germany. In addition, component teams performed audit procedures on specified account balances in 24 
cons units also covering Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritania & Senegal, Indonesia, Egypt, India and Abu Dhabi. 
The group engagement team performed audit procedures on specified account balances to component materiality, with certain additional specific 
procedures performed by component teams, covering an additional 25 cons units (2023 27).
The remaining cons units are not significant individually and include many small, low risk components and balances. On average, they each represent 
0.04% of revenue (2023 0.04%), 0.04% of property, plant and equipment (2023 0.03%) and 0.04% of profit before tax (2023 0.04%). 
In our assessment of the residual balances not covered by the above procedures, we have considered the risk that there could be undetected and 
uncorrected misstatements that are material in the aggregate within the large number of geographically dispersed businesses, in particular within the C&P 
segment. This assessment included use of our analytic tools to interrogate data, preparation of trend analysis and comparison of business performance to 
market benchmark prices. We also tested management's group-wide controls across a range of locations and segments. We concluded that through this 
additional risk assessment, we have reduced the audit risk of such misstatements arising to a sufficiently low level.
Our audit coverage of ‘Property, plant and equipment’, ‘Revenue’ and ‘Profit before tax’ is materially the same as in the prior year.

7.2 Our consideration of the control environment
Our audit approach was generally to place reliance on management’s relevant controls over all business cycles affecting in scope financial statement line 
items. We tested a sample of these controls through a combination of tests of inquiry, observation, inspection and re-performance. 
In limited situations where we were not able to take a controls reliance approach due to controls being deficient and there not being sufficient mitigating or 
alternative controls we could rely on instead, we adopted a non-controls reliance approach. All control deficiencies which we considered to be significant 
were communicated to the audit committee. All other deficiencies were communicated to management. For all deficiencies identified we considered the 
impact and updated our audit plan accordingly.
The group’s financial systems environment is complex, with 101 separate IT systems scoped as being relevant to the audit for the following key locations 
(UK, US, Germany, Azerbaijan and Australia) as well as other minor locations. These systems are all directly or indirectly relevant to the entity’s financial 
reporting process.
We planned to rely on the General IT Controls (‘GITCs’) associated with these systems, and having tested controls over access security, change 
management, data centre operations and network operations, were able to do so.
7.3 Working with other auditors
The group audit team is responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process and providing direct oversight, review, and coordination of our 
component audit teams. We interacted regularly with the component Deloitte teams during each stage of the audit and reviewed key working papers. We 
maintained continuous and open dialogue with our component teams in addition to holding formal meetings quarterly to ensure that we were fully aware 
of their progress and results of their procedures.
Consistent with prior year, the senior statutory auditor and other group audit partners and staff conducted visits to meet with the component teams 
responsible for the audits of specified account balances during the year. These visits included attending planning meetings, discussing the audit approach 
including the risk assessments and any issues arising from the component team's work, meetings with local management, and reviewing key audit 
working papers on higher and significant-risk areas to drive a consistent and high-quality audit. In addition, a global audit planning meeting was held in 
London for three days in July led by the senior statutory auditor and involving the group audit team, partners and staff from all full scope component 
teams, audit teams responsible for testing at key Global Business Services (GBS) locations and senior management from bp.

8. Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this 
gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.We have nothing to report 
in this regard.
9. Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to 
liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
10. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined 
above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting 
irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. 
11.1 Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities
In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we 
considered the following:
•our meetings throughout the year with the Group Head of Ethics and Compliance and reviews of bp’s internal ethics and compliance reporting 
summaries, including those concerning investigations;
•enquiries of management, internal audit, and the audit committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the group’s 
policies and procedures relating to:
– identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;
– detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and
– the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;
•review of the terms of reference of the Fraud Governance Board set up by management to support the creation and delivery of the Group Fraud Risk 
Strategy, periodically monitor the threat outlook and review the risk appetite;
•review of the Fraud Governance Board’s meeting minutes and its fraud risk assessment; 
•the group’s remuneration policies, key drivers for remuneration and bonus levels; and
•discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. 
The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with companies in the same sectors as bp operates, 
and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved fraud specialists who advised the 
engagement team of fraud schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries, and they participated in the initial fraud risk assessment 
discussions.Financial statements

In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.
We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the group operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and 
regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we 
considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, UK Corporate Governance Code, US Securities Exchange Act 1934 and relevant SEC 
regulations, as well as laws and regulations prevailing in each country in which we identified a full-scope component.
In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which 
may be fundamental to the group’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the group’s operating licences and environmental 
regulations.
11.2 Audit response to risks identified
As a result of performing the above, we did not identify any key audit matters related to the potential risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We 
did identify two key audit matters relating to fraud risks, as described above, being the valuation of commodity financial derivatives, and management 
override of controls. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we 
performed in response to those key audit matters.
In addition to the above, procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:
•reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and 
regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;
•enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;
•obtaining confirmations from external legal counsel concerning open litigation and claims;
•performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud; and
•reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with HMRC and the IRS.
We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists 
and component audit teams and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
12. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
•The information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
•The strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have 
not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
13. Corporate Governance Statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the group’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is 
materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit: 
•the directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties 
identified set out on page 113
•the directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the group’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out 
on page 113
•the directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 113
•the board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 112
•the section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on page 112 and
•the section describing the work of the audit committee set out on pages 82-85.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the shareholders and board of directors of BP p.l.c.
Opinion on the financial statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated group balance sheets of BP p.l.c. and subsidiaries (together ‘bp’ or ‘the group’) as at 31 December 2024 
and 2023, the related consolidated group income statements, group statements of comprehensive income, group statements of changes in equity and 
group cash flow statements, for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 
‘financial statements’). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as at 31 December 
2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2024, in accordance with 
United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) and as adopted by the European Union (EU).
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), bp's internal control 
over financial reporting as of 31 December 2024, based on criteria established in the UK Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and Business reporting relating to internal control over financial reporting and our report dated 6 March 2025 
expressed an unqualified opinion on bp's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of bp’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on bp’s financial statements based on 
our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to bp in accordance with the U.S. 
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included 
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures 
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or 
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) 
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on 
the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical 
audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
1. Impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets – Notes 1, 4 and 12 to the financial statements 
Critical Audit Matter Description
The group balance sheet as at 31 December 2024 includes PP&E, of which $56 billion is oil and gas properties.
Management’s best estimate oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment tests were revised in 2024 as set out in Note 1 on page 152, 
although the revisions were not significant. 
Management have also determined bp’s ‘best estimate’ discount rate assumptions, as set out in Note 1 on page 152. Bp’s post-tax discount rate used for 
impairment testing for oil and gas assets in 2024 remained unchanged from prior year at 8%. Pre-tax discount rates applied in impairment tests were 
revised in some regions to reflect changes in local tax rates and country risk premiums. Reserves estimates for all oil and gas fields were also reviewed 
and updated where necessary at year-end.  
Management judged that in aggregate, the year-end oil and gas price assumption revisions, changes to pre-tax discount rates for certain regions due to 
country risk premium or tax rate changes and changes to other input assumptions including reserves reductions on several key fields, all combined to 
constitute an impairment trigger for all oil and gas cash generating units (CGUs). As a result of testing performed during 2024, $2.0 billion of oil and gas 
CGU net impairment charges were recognised, principally due to certain discount rate revisions, an increase in certain capital expenditure forecasts and 
operating expenditure forecasts and certain reserves write downs.
We identified three key management estimates in management’s determination of the level of impairment charge and/or impairment reversal. These are:
Oil and gas prices  – bp’s oil and gas price assumptions have a significant impact on many CGU impairment assessments performed across the 
OP&O and G&LCE segments and are inherently uncertain. The estimation of future prices is subject to increased uncertainty given climate change, 
the global energy transition, macro-economic factors and disruption in global supply due to ongoing geo-political conflicts. There is a risk that 
management do not forecast reasonable ‘best estimate’ oil and gas price forecasts when assessing CGUs for impairment charge and/or impairment 
reversal, leading to material misstatements. These price assumptions are highly judgmental and are pervasive inputs to bp’s oil and gas CGU 
valuation. There is also a risk that management’s oil and gas price related disclosures are not reasonable.
Discount rates  – Given the long timeframes involved, certain CGU impairment assessments are sensitive to the discount rate applied. Discount 
rates should reflect the return required by the market and the risks inherent in the cash flows being discounted. There is a risk that management 
does not assume reasonable discount rates, adjusted as applicable for country risks and relevant tax rates, leading to material misstatements. 
Determining a reasonable discount rate is highly judgmental and, consistent with price assumptions above, the discount rate assumption is also a 
pervasive input across bp’s oil and gas CGU valuations, before adjustments for asset specific risks and tax rates.
Reserves and resources estimates  – A key input to certain CGU impairment assessments is the oil and gas production forecast, which is based on 
underlying reserves estimates and field specific development assumptions. Certain CGU production forecasts include specific risk adjusted resource 
volumes, in addition to proven and/or probable reserves estimates, that are inherently less certain than reserves; and assumptions related to these 
volumes can be particularly judgemental. There is a risk that material misstatements could arise from unreasonable production forecasts for 
individually material CGUs and/or from the aggregation of systematic flaws in bp’s reserves and resources estimation policies across the OP&O and 
G&LCE segments. 
134 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

We identified certain individual CGUs which we determined would be most at risk of material impairment charges as a result of a reasonably possible 
change in the oil and gas price assumptions. This population includes previously impaired assets which are also at risk of material impairment reversal 
resulting from potential oil and gas price assumption changes. We identified that a subset of these CGUs was also individually materially sensitive to the 
discount rate assumption.
We also identified CGUs which were less sensitive as they would be potentially at risk, in aggregate, to a material impairment by a reasonably possible 
change in some or all of the key assumptions.  
Impairment charge and/or impairment reversal assessments of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets remain a critical audit matter because recoverable 
values are reliant on forecast assumptions such as oil and gas prices, discount rates and reserves estimates, which are inherently judgemental, complex 
for management to estimate and challenging to audit. Additionally, the magnitude of the potential misstatement risk remains material to the group.
How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit
We tested relevant internal controls over the estimation of oil and gas prices, discount rates, and reserve and resources estimates, as well as relevant 
internal controls over the performance of the impairment charge and/or impairment reversal assessments where we identified audit risks. In addition, we 
conducted the following substantive procedures.
Oil and gas prices 
•We independently developed a reasonable range of forecasts based on external data obtained, against which we compared management’s oil and gas 
price assumptions in order to challenge whether they are reasonable.
•In developing this range, we obtained a variety of reputable and reliable third party forecasts, peer information and other relevant market data. 
•In challenging and evaluating management’s price assumptions, we considered the extent to which they and each of the forecast pricing scenarios 
obtained from third parties reflect the impact of lower oil and gas demand due to climate change and the energy transition. 
•The 2015 Conference of the Parties (CoP) 21 Paris Agreement goals of ‘holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above 
pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’ was reaffirmed at CoP 29 in Baku during 
November 2024. We specifically analysed third party forecasts stated, or interpreted by us, as being consistent with scenarios achieving the Paris ‘well 
below 2°C goal’ and/or ‘1.5°C ambition’ and evaluated whether they presented contradictory audit evidence.
•We assessed management’s disclosures in Note 1, including the sensitivity of forecast revenue cash inflows to lower oil and gas prices and how 
climate change and the energy transition, potential future emissions costs and/or reduced demand scenarios may impact bp to a greater extent than 
currently anticipated in bp’s value-in-use estimates for oil and gas CGUs.
Discount rates
•We independently evaluated bp’s discount rates used in impairment tests with input from our valuation specialists, against relevant third party market 
and peer data.
•When performing procedures over specific assets, we assessed whether specific country risks and tax adjustments were reasonably reflected in bp’s 
discount rates.
•We challenged and evaluated management’s disclosures in Note 1, including in relation to the sensitivity of discount rate assumptions.
Reserves and resources estimates
With the assistance of our oil and gas reserves specialists we:
•assessed bp’s reserves and resources estimation methods and policies for reasonableness;
•assessed how these policies had been applied to a sample of bp’s reserves and resources estimates;
•read and evaluated a sample of reports provided by management’s external reserves experts and assessed the scope of work and findings of these 
third parties;
•assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of bp’s internal and external reserve experts, through understanding their relevant professional 
qualifications and experience;
•assessed whether management’s production forecasts are consistent overall with bp’s strategy;
•compared the production forecasts used in the impairment tests with management’s approved reserves and resources estimates; and
•performed a retrospective assessment in order to assess management's ability to accurately estimate reserves and resources and to check for 
indications of estimation bias over time.
2. Decommissioning provisions – Notes 1 and 23 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
A decommissioning provision of $11.8 billion is recorded in the financial statements as at 31 December 2024. The estimation of decommissioning 
provisions is a highly judgemental area as it involves a number of key estimates related to the cost and timing of decommissioning, in particular inflation 
and discount rate assumptions. 
Management estimates that the average rate of forecast inflation applicable to the substantial majority of bp’s decommissioning cost estimates is 1.5%, 
which is 0.5% lower than its estimated long term general inflation rate of 2%.  
The estimated undiscounted cost of the obligations and the timing of future payments are set out in Note 1 on page 159. Economic factors, future 
activities and the legislative environments that bp operates in are used to inform cost estimates, whereas the timing of decommissioning activities is 
dependent on cessation of production (CoP) dates, which are sensitive to changes in bp’s price forecasts as price estimates determine economic cut off of 
oil and gas reserve estimates.  
bp increased the discount rate used in calculating its decommissioning provisions from 4.0% as at 31 December 2023 to 4.5% as at 31 December 2024. 
The increase was primarily driven by increased US treasury bond rates.Financial statements
bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 135

How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit
Long term Inflation rate
•We tested the relevant control related to the determination of the decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption.
•We tested how management derived the decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption of 1.5%, and the evidence on which it is based, by gaining 
an understanding of the process used by management, testing management’s calculations of the assumption, and evaluating the evidence relevant to 
management’s assumption, both supporting and contradictory.
•As the 1.5% decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption is determined by making an adjustment to management’s 2.0% general long term 
inflation rate assumption, we evaluated the general long term inflation rate assumption used of 2.0%, comparing it against latest external market data. 
•We made inquiries and evaluated the competence, capabilities and objectivity, of management’s decommissioning experts who derived the 
decommissioning specific inflation rate.
•We inspected analyst forecasts and reports in respect of the future decommissioning market and related costs for evidence of supporting and 
contradictory evidence, with particular focus on the future rig market.
•We particularly considered the expectation that demand for oil and gas products and related activities will decrease, primarily in response to climate 
change and energy transition effects pivoting future energy industry investment and development activity towards renewable sources. We challenged 
and evaluated management’s assessment of the impact this will have on the decommissioning market and related inflation assumption.
•We analysed historical trends of rig market rates against oil prices and historical inflation to evaluate management’s assumption that the 
decommissioning inflation assumption does not inflate at the same rate as general inflation.
Cost and timing estimates
•We tested the relevant controls over the year end decommissioning cost and timing assumptions used within management’s decommissioning 
provision estimate.
•We assessed the completeness and accuracy of the assets subject to decommissioning, including understanding the process to establish whether a 
legal or constructive obligation existed.
•We evaluated the reasonableness of changes in key cost assumptions, including rig rates, vessel rates, well plug and abandonment duration, and non-
productive time assumptions, with reference to internal and appropriate third-party data.
•We assessed changes in assumptions for the estimated date of decommissioning and evaluated whether CoP dates used for decommissioning 
estimation are aligned with CoP assumptions in other areas, including PP&E impairment testing and oil and gas reserve estimation.
•We assessed the accuracy of bp’s disclosure of the estimated undiscounted cost of its obligations and the timing of future decommissioning 
payments.
Discount rates
•We tested the relevant controls related to the determination of the discount rate assumption.
•We assessed the reasonableness of management’s methodology for determining the discount rate and recalculated the discount rate with reference to 
independent third party data, most notably US treasury bond yields.

3. Valuation of commodity financial derivatives - Notes 1, 29 and 30 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
bp’s supply, trading and shipping (ST&S) function is responsible for globally trading and risk managing the group’s owned as well as third party production. 
To discharge this responsibility, ST&S regularly executes commodity contracts, physically settled or otherwise, which are accounted for as a derivative and 
fair valued under IFRS 9. These contracts, therefore, result in unrealised gains/losses that are recognised on account of fair value movements in the 
associated derivative assets and liabilities.
Determining the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities can be complex and subjective, particularly where the valuation is dependent on significant 
inputs which are not observable and are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy set out in IFRS 13. This degree of subjectivity also makes such fair 
value estimates liable to potential fraud by management incorporating bias in the inputs used in determining fair values. Given the significant judgements, 
sensitivity to management assumptions, and the absolute value associated with these positions, we have identified a risk in respect of certain financial 
instruments where the valuation is dependent on significant unobservable inputs.
Fair value measurements associated with unrealised commodity contracts are also impacted by the macroeconomic sentiment and outlook. In 2024, 
commodity markets continued to experience periods of volatility due to continuing uncertainty resulting from the planned energy transition, macro-
economic factors such as inflation and interest rates, and disruptions in global supply due to geopolitical conflicts. In response to the volatility observed, 
we focused our audit efforts on the valuation of commodity derivatives and designed procedures to test for management bias. 
As at 31 December 2024, the group’s total level 3 derivative financial assets were $16.0 billion and level 3 derivative financial liabilities were $14.4 billion.
How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit
To address the complexities associated with auditing the valuation of instruments dependent on significant unobservable inputs, we included valuation 
specialists with significant quantitative and modelling expertise to assist in performing our audit procedures. Our valuation audit work included the 
following control and substantive procedures:
•We tested the group’s valuation relevant controls including:
– the model certification control, which is designed to review a model’s theoretical soundness and the appropriateness of its valuation methodology; 
and
– the independent price verification control, which is designed to review the appropriateness of valuation inputs that are not observable and are 
significant to the financial instrument’s valuation.
•We performed valuation testing procedures including:
– evaluating management’s valuation methodologies against standard valuation practice and analysing whether a consistent framework is applied 
across the business period over period;
– engaging our valuation specialists to challenge models, develop fair value estimates and evaluate consistency in management’s modelling and input 
assumptions throughout the year;
– comparing management’s input assumptions against the expected assumptions of other market participants and observable market data;
– independently validating price points on pricing curves to consensus data; and
– analysing whether there was any indication of management bias through evaluating the distribution of valuation differences where relevant.Financial statements

4. Impairment of E&A assets and refinery PP&E as a consequence, among other things, of climate change and the energy transition – 
Notes 1, 4, 8 and 15 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Intangible Assets
The recoverability of certain of the group’s $4.4 billion total exploration and appraisal (E&A) assets capitalised as at 31 December 2024 is potentially 
exposed to climate change and the global energy transition risk factors (see Note 15). This is because a greater number of E&A projects may not proceed 
as a consequence of the energy transition, or lower forecast future oil and gas prices. The determination of whether and when E&A costs should be written 
off, impaired, or retained on the balance sheet as E&A assets, remains complex and continues to require significant management judgement.
PP&E
The carrying value of bp’s refining assets within PP&E may no longer be recoverable, due to changes in supply and demand which arise among other 
things as a consequence of climate change and the energy transition. Management identified impairment indicators in respect of the Gelsenkirchen 
refinery in Germany during the year and, as a result, an impairment test was performed to assess the recoverability of the Gelsenkirchen refinery carrying 
value. As disclosed in Note 4 to the accounts on page 166, management has recorded an impairment charge of $0.8 billion in respect of the Gelsenkirchen 
refinery, primarily driven by changes in economic assumptions. At 31 December 2024 management identified an impairment indicator for all of its other 
refineries due to a reduction in the local marker margins.  The impairment tests performed by management to assess the recoverability of the carrying 
value of these refineries did not result in any additional impairment charges being recognised.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Intangible Assets 
In respect of the recoverability of E&A assets capitalised as at 31 December 2024:
•We tested the relevant controls within the group’s E&A write-off and impairment assessment processes; and 
•We challenged and evaluated management’s key E&A judgements with regards to the impairment criteria of IFRS 6. Where impairment indicators were 
identified we corroborated key judgements with internal and external evidence for assets that remained on the balance sheet. This included analysing 
evidence of future E&A plans, budgets and capital allocation decisions, assessing management’s key accounting judgement papers, reading meeting 
minutes and assessing licence documentation and evidence of active dialogue with partners and regulators including negotiations to renew licences or 
modify key terms.
PP&E
We considered the impact of potential changes in supply and demand on the group’s refining portfolio and assessed internal and external market studies 
of future supply and demand. In relation to refinery impairment tests performed by management, our audit procedures included:
•Evaluating the valuation methodology and testing the integrity and mechanical accuracy of the impairment models;  
•Assessing the appropriateness of key assumptions and inputs to the impairment models, notably forecast refining margins, discount rate and energy 
input costs, challenging and evaluating management’s assumptions by reference to third party data where available and involvement of our valuation 
specialists; and 
•Evaluating management’s ability to forecast future cash flows and margins by comparing actual results with historical forecasts and tested 
management’s internal controls over the impairment test and related inputs.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the shareholders and board of directors of BP p.l.c.
Opinion on internal control over financial reporting 
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of BP p.l.c. and its subsidiaries (the group) as of 31 December 2024, based on the criteria 
established in the UK Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting relating 
to internal control over financial reporting (UK FRC Guidance). In our opinion, the group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over 
financial reporting as of 31 December 2024, based on the criteria established in the UK FRC Guidance.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated 
financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2024, of the group and our report dated 6 March 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on 
those financial statements.
As described in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over 
financial reporting at bp bioenergy (formerly called Bunge Bioenergia) and Lightsource bp which were acquired on 1 October 2024, and 24 October 2024, 
respectively. bp bioenergy financial statement line items comprise 2.1% and 0.9% of net and total assets respectively, 0.3% of sales and other operating 
revenues, and (4.5)% of profit (loss) for the year of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 31 December 2024. 
Lightsource bp’s financial statement line items comprise 6.3% and 2.4% of net and total assets respectively, 0.1% of sales and other operating revenues, 
and (5.7)% of profit (loss) for the year of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 31 December 2024. Accordingly, our 
audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at bp bioenergy and Lightsource bp.
Basis for opinion
The Group’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of 
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility 
is to express an opinion on the group’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the 
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the group in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an 
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately

Notes on financial statements
1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions 
Authorization of financial statements and statement of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards
The consolidated financial statements of BP p.l.c and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as bp or the group) were approved and signed by the chief 
executive officer and chairman on 6 March 2025 having been duly authorized to do so by the board of directors. BP p.l.c. is a public limited company 
incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted 
international accounting standards and IFRS Accounting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and as 
adopted by the European Union (EU) and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under 
international accounting standards. IFRS as adopted by the UK does not differ from IFRS as adopted by the EU. IFRS as adopted by the UK and EU differs 
in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. The differences have no impact on the group’s consolidated financial statements for the years 
presented. The material accounting policy information and accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions of the group are set out below.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with IFRSs and IFRS Interpretations Committee 
(IFRIC) interpretations issued and effective for the year ended 31 December 2024. The accounting policies that follow have been consistently applied to all 
years presented, except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars ($ million), except where 
otherwise indicated.
Material accounting policy information: use of judgements, estimates and assumptions
Inherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements is the need for bp management to 
make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, 
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The accounting 
judgements and estimates that have a significant impact on the results of the group are set out in boxed text below, and should be read in conjunction with 
the information provided in the Notes on financial statements. 
The areas requiring the most significant judgement and estimation in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are: accounting for the 
investments in Rosneft and Aker BP; exploration and appraisal intangible assets; the recoverability of asset carrying values, including the estimation of 
reserves; supplier financing arrangements; derivative financial instruments; provisions and contingencies; pensions and other post-employment benefits; 
and taxation. Judgements and estimates, not all of which are significant, made in assessing the impact of the current economic and geopolitical 
environment, and climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy on the consolidated financial statements are also set out in boxed text 
below. Where an estimate has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year this is specifically noted within the boxed text.
Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy
Climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy were considered in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These may have 
significant impacts on the currently reported amounts of the group’s assets and liabilities discussed below and on similar assets and liabilities that may 
be recognized in the future. The group’s assumptions for investment appraisal (see page 20) form part of an investment decision-making framework for 
currently unsanctioned future capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment, and intangibles including exploration and appraisal assets, that is 
designed to support the effective and resilient implementation of bp’s strategy. The price assumptions used for investment appraisal include oil and gas 
price assumptions, which are producer prices and are therefore net of any future carbon prices that the purchaser may be required to pay, and an 
assumption of a single carbon emissions cost imposed on the producer in respect of operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide and 
methane) in order to incentivize engineering solutions to mitigate GHG emissions on projects. The group's oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use 
impairment testing are aligned with those investment appraisal assumptions. The assumptions for future carbon emissions costs in value-in-use 
impairment testing differ from the investment appraisal assumptions and are described below. 
Management has also not identified any off-balance sheet commodity purchase obligations to be onerous contracts as result of the transition to a lower 
carbon economy at 31 December 2024.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and goodwill
The energy transition is likely to impact the future prices of commodities such as oil and natural gas which in turn may affect the recoverable amount of 
property, plant and equipment and goodwill in the oil and gas industry. Management’s best estimate of oil and natural gas price assumptions for value-in-
use impairment testing were revised during 2024. The revised price assumptions have been rebased in real 2023 terms and are materially consistent with 
the disclosed prices in real 2022 terms. The near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per barrel to reflect near-term supply constraints 
before declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy system decarbonizes, falling oil demand will 
cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00 per mmBtu reflecting an assumption that 
declining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. The revised assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub gas sit within the range of 
external scenarios considered by management and are in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate 
change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
As noted above, the group’s investment appraisal process includes a carbon emissions price series for the investment economics which is applied to 
bp's anticipated share of bp's forecast of the investment assets' scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions where they exceed defined thresholds, and is assumed to 
apply whether or not bp is the asset operator. However, for value-in-use impairment testing on bp's existing cash generating units (CGUs), consistent with 
all other relevant cash flows estimated, bp is required to reflect management's best estimate of any expected applicable carbon emission costs payable 
by bp, including where bp is not the operator, in the future for each jurisdiction in which the group has interests. This requires management’s best 
estimate of how future changes to relevant carbon emission cost policies and/or legislation are likely to affect the future cash flows of the group’s 
applicable CGUs, whether currently enacted or not. Future potential carbon pricing and/or costs of carbon emissions allowances are included in the 
value-in-use calculations to the extent management has sufficient information to make such an estimate. Currently this results in limited application of 
carbon price assumptions in value-in-use impairment tests given that carbon pricing legislation in most impacted jurisdictions where the group has 
interests is not in place and there is not sufficient information available as to the relevant policy makers' future intentions regarding carbon pricing to 
support an estimate. A key input into the determination of impairment is the assumption, aligned with bp’s aim to reach net zero greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2050 or sooner, that the current recognized portfolio of oil and gas properties and refining assets will have an immaterial carrying value by 
2050. 
Where we consider that the outcome of a value-in-use impairment test could be significantly affected by a carbon price in place in any jurisdiction, this is 
incorporated into the value-in use impairment testing cash flows. The most significant instances where a carbon price has been incorporated in the 2024 
value-in-use impairment tests is for the UK North Sea and the Gelsenkirchen refinery. The assumptions for UK North Sea were £59/tCO 2e in 2025 
gradually increasing to £231/tCO 2e in 2050. The assumption applied for the Gelsenkirchen refinery was an average of approximately $97/tCO 2e.
However, as bp’s forecast future prices are producer prices, the group considers it reasonable to assume that if, in addition to the costs already in place, 
further scope 1 and 2 emission costs were partially to be borne directly by oil and gas producers including bp in future and the prevalence of such costs 
were to become widespread, the gross oil and gas prices realized by producers would be correspondingly higher over the long term, resulting in no 
expected overall materially negative impacts on the group’s net cash flows. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying 
values for further information including sensitivity analysis in relation to reasonably possible changes in the price assumptions and carbon costs. 
Production assumptions within upstream property, plant and equipment and goodwill value-in-use impairment tests reflect management’s current best 
estimate of future production of the existing upstream portfolio. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and 
Note 14 for sensitivity analyses in relation to reasonably possible changes in production for upstream oil and gas properties and goodwill respectively.
For the customers & products segment, though the energy transition may impact demand for certain refined products in the future, management 
anticipates sufficiently robust demand for the remainder of each refinery’s useful life.
Management will continue to review price assumptions as the energy transition progresses and this may result in impairment charges or reversals in the 
future. 
Exploration and appraisal intangible assets
The energy transition may affect the future development or viability of exploration prospects. The recoverability of the group's exploration and appraisal 
intangible assets was considered during 2024. No significant write-offs were identified. These assets will continue to be assessed as the energy 
transition progresses. See significant judgement: exploration and appraisal intangible assets and Note 8 for further information. 
Property, plant and equipment – depreciation and expected useful lives
The energy transition may curtail the expected useful lives of oil and gas industry assets thereby accelerating depreciation charges. However, a 
significant majority of bp’s existing upstream oil and natural gas properties are likely to have immaterial carrying values within the next 12 years and, as 
outlined in bp's strategy, oil and natural gas production will remain an important part of bp’s business activities over that period. The significant majority 
of refining assets, recognized on the group’s balance sheet at 31 December 2024 that are subject to depreciation, will be depreciated within the next 12 
years; demand for refined products is expected to remain sufficient to support the remaining useful lives of existing assets. Therefore, management does 
not expect the useful lives of bp’s reported property, plant and equipment to change and do not consider this to be a significant accounting judgement or 
estimate. Significant capital expenditure is still required for ongoing projects as well as renewal and/or replacement of aged assets and therefore the 
useful lives of future capital expenditure may be different. See material accounting policy: property, plant and equipment for more information.

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Provisions: decommissioning
The energy transition may bring forward the decommissioning of oil and gas industry assets thereby increasing the present value of associated 
decommissioning provisions. The majority of bp’s existing upstream oil and gas properties are expected to start decommissioning within the next two 
decades. Currently, the expected timing of decommissioning expenditures for the upstream oil and gas assets in the group’s portfolio has not materially 
been brought forward. Management does not expect a reasonably possible change of two years in the expected timing of all decommissioning to have a 
material effect on the upstream decommissioning provisions, assuming cost assumptions remain unchanged. 
Decommissioning cost estimates are based on the known regulatory and external environment. These cost estimates may change in the future, including 
as a result of the transition to a lower carbon economy. For refineries, decommissioning provisions are generally not recognized as the associated 
obligations have indeterminate settlement dates, typically driven by the cessation of manufacturing. Management does not expect manufacturing to 
cease at refineries within a determinate period of time, as existing property, plant and equipment is expected to be renewed or replaced. Management will 
continue to review facts and circumstances, including where cessation of manufacturing decisions have been made,  to assess if decommissioning 
provisions need to be recognized. Decommissioning provisions relating to refineries at 31 December 2024 are not material. See significant judgements 
and estimates: provisions for further information.
Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of the geopolitical and economic environment
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the following areas involving judgement and estimates were identified as most relevant with regards 
to the impact of the current geopolitical and economic environment. 
Oil and gas price assumptions
Oil and gas price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing have been updated for inflation and have been rebased in real 2023 terms.  See 
significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values for further information.
Discount rate assumptions
The discount rates used for impairment testing and provisions were reassessed during the year in light of changing economic and geopolitical outlooks. 
The nominal discount rate applied to provisions was increased during the year to reflect higher US Treasury yields. The principal impact of this rate 
increase was a $0.9 billion decrease in the decommissioning provision with an associated decrease in the carrying amount of property, plant and 
equipment of $0.7 billion and a pre-tax credit to the income statement of $0.2 billion. The post-tax impairment discount rate applicable to assets other 
than renewable power assets remained consistent with 2023 as did the risk premium applied to the majority of countries classified as higher-risk. See 
significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and provisions for further information. 
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The volatility in the financial markets during 2024 impacted the assumptions used for determining the fair value of plan assets and the present value of 
defined benefit obligations in the group’s defined benefit pension plans. See significant estimate: pensions and other post-employment benefits and Note 
24 for further information.
Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of BP p.l.c. and its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year. Subsidiaries are 
consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, including when control is obtained via potential voting 
rights, and continue to be consolidated until the date that control ceases. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. Intra-group 
balances and transactions, including unrealized profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated unless 
the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to bp shareholders. Included within non-
controlling interests are perpetual subordinated hybrid securities issued by subsidiaries and for which the group has the unconditional right to avoid 
transferring cash or another financial asset to the holders. Profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders is adjusted to reflect the coupon/interest related to 
these hybrid securities whether or not such distribution has been deferred. 
Interests in other entities
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair 
values at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest and 
the acquisition-date fair values of any previously held interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
at the acquisition date. The amount recognized for any non-controlling interest is measured at the present ownership's proportionate share in the 
recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. At the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating 
units, or groups of cash-generating units, expected to benefit from the combination’s synergies. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising on business combinations prior to 1 January 2003 is stated at the previous carrying amount 
under UK generally accepted accounting practice, less subsequent impairments.
Goodwill may arise upon investments in joint ventures and associates, being the surplus of the cost of investment over the group’s share of the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets and liabilities. Any such goodwill is recorded within the corresponding investment in joint ventures and associates.
Goodwill may also arise upon acquisition of interests in joint operations that meet the definition of a business. The amount of goodwill separately 
recognized is the excess of the consideration transferred over the group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities. Financial statements

Interests in joint arrangements
The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting as 
described below.
Certain of the group’s activities, particularly in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments, are conducted through joint 
operations. bp recognizes, on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements, its share of the assets, liabilities and expenses of these joint 
operations incurred jointly with the other partners, along with the group’s revenue from the sale of its share of the output and any liabilities and expenses 
that the group has incurred in relation to the joint operation.
For joint arrangements in a separate entity, judgement may be required as to whether the arrangement should be classified as a joint venture or if the legal 
form, contractual arrangements or other facts and circumstances indicate that the group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the 
arrangement, rather than rights to the net assets, and therefore should be classified as a joint operation. No such judgement made by the group is 
considered significant. 
Interests in associates
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting as 
described below.
Significant judgement: investment in Aker BP
Judgement is required in assessing the level of control or influence over another entity in which the group holds an interest. For bp, the judgement that 
the group has significant influence over Aker BP, a Norwegian oil and gas company, is significant. 
As a consequence of this judgement, bp uses the equity method of accounting for its investment and bp's share of Aker BP's oil and natural gas reserves 
is included in the group's estimated net proved reserves of equity-accounted entities. If significant influence was not present, the investment would be 
accounted for as an investment in an equity instrument measured at fair value as described under 'Financial assets' below and no share of Aker BP's oil 
and natural gas reserves would be reported.
Significant influence is defined in IFRS as the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint 
control of those decisions. Significant influence is presumed when an entity owns 20% or more of the voting power of the investee. Significant influence 
is presumed not to be present when an entity owns less than 20% of the voting power of the investee. 
bp owned 15.9% of the voting shares at 31 December 2024. bp’s senior vice president North Sea, Doris Reiter, was appointed a member of the Aker BP 
board during 2024. bp’s other nominated director, group chief financial officer, Kate Thomson, has been a member of the Aker BP board since formation 
of that company in 2016. She is also a member of the Aker BP board’s Audit and Risk Committee. bp also holds the voting rights at general meetings of 
shareholders conferred by its stake in Aker BP. bp's management considers, therefore, that the group continues to have significant influence at 31 
December 2024.
Significant judgements and estimate: investment in Rosneft
Since the first quarter 2022, bp accounts for its interest in Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia, as financial assets measured at 
fair value within ‘Other investments’. bp is not able to sell its Rosneft shares on the Moscow Stock Exchange and is unable to ascribe probabilities to 
possible outcomes of any exit process. It is considered by management that any measure of fair value, other than nil, would be subject to such high 
measurement uncertainty, considering the sanctions and restrictions implemented by Russia on Russian assets held by foreign investors, that no 
estimate would provide useful information even if it were accompanied by a description of the estimate made in producing it and an explanation of the 
uncertainties that affect the estimate. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to estimate any carrying value other than zero when determining the 
measurement of the interest in Rosneft and the other businesses with Rosneft within Russia as at 31 December 2024. Events or outcomes within the 
next financial year, that are different to those outlined above, could materially change the fair value of the investment.
Russia has imposed restrictions on the payments of dividends to certain foreign shareholders, including those based in the UK, requiring such dividends 
to be paid in roubles into restricted bank accounts and a requirement for approval of the Russian government for transfers from any such bank accounts 
out of Russia. Given the restrictions applicable to such accounts, management has made the significant judgement that the criteria for recognizing any 
dividend income from Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia, for the years to 31 December 2022, 31 December 2023 and 31 
December 2024 have not been met. 
The equity method of accounting
Under the equity method, an investment is carried on the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the group’s share of net assets of the 
entity, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of the investment. Loans advanced to equity-accounted entities that have the 
characteristics of equity financing are also included in the investment on the group balance sheet. The group income statement reflects the group’s share 
of the results after tax of the equity-accounted entity, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortization and any impairment of the equity-accounted 
entity’s assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. The group statement of comprehensive income includes the group’s share of the equity-
accounted entity’s other comprehensive income. The group’s share of amounts recognized directly in equity by an equity-accounted entity is recognized in 
the group’s statement of changes in equity.
Financial statements of equity-accounted entities are typically prepared for the same reporting year as the group. Where material differences arise in the 
accounting policies used by the equity-accounted entity and those used by bp, adjustments are made to those financial statements to bring the accounting 
policies used into line with those of the group. Unrealized gains on transactions, apart from those that meet the definition of a derivative, between the 
group and its equity-accounted entities are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in the equity-accounted entity. This includes unrealized gains 
arising on contribution of a business on formation of an equity-accounted entity.

Segmental reporting
The group’s operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the group that are evaluated regularly by the chief executive officer, 
bp’s chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. 
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the group’s accounting policies described in this note, except that IFRS requires that 
the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker. For bp, 
this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit before interest and tax which reflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is 
arrived at by excluding inventory holding gains and losses from profit before interest and tax. Replacement cost profit for the group is not a recognized 
measure under IFRS. 
For further information see Note 5. 
Foreign currency translation
In individual subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of those entities 
at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the 
functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement, unless 
hedge accounting is applied. Non-monetary items, other than those measured at fair value, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition.
In the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, and related 
goodwill, are translated into US dollars at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. The results and cash flows of non-US dollar functional 
currency subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars using average rates of exchange. In the consolidated financial 
statements, exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by non-US dollar functional currency 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other 
comprehensive income. Exchange gains and losses arising on long-term intra-group foreign currency borrowings used to finance the group’s non-US dollar 
investments are also reported in other comprehensive income if the borrowings form part of the net investment in the subsidiary, joint venture or 
associate. On disposal or for certain partial disposals of a non-US dollar functional currency subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the related accumulated 
exchange gains and losses recognized in equity are reclassified from equity to the income statement.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Significant non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets. Management must be committed to 
the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and 
actions required to complete the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be 
withdrawn.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortized, and equity accounting of associates and joint ventures is ceased 
once classified as held for sale.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, include expenditure on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources, biogas rights agreements, 
digital assets, patents, licences and trademarks and are stated at the amount initially recognized, less accumulated amortization and accumulated 
impairment losses.
Intangible assets are carried initially at cost unless acquired as part of a business combination. Any such asset is measured at fair value at the date of the 
business combination and is recognized separately from goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights.
Intangible assets with a finite life, other than capitalized exploration and appraisal costs as described below, are amortized on a straight-line basis over 
their expected useful lives. For patents, licences and trademarks, expected useful life is the shorter of the duration of the legal agreement and economic 
useful life, and can range from three to fifteen years. The expected useful life of biogas rights agreements is the shorter of the duration of the legal 
agreement and economic useful life and can be up to 50 years. Digital asset costs generally have a useful life of three to five years.
The expected useful lives of assets and the amortization method are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives or the 
amortization method are accounted for prospectively.
Oil and natural gas exploration and appraisal expenditure
Oil and natural gas exploration and appraisal expenditure is accounted for using the principles of the successful efforts method of accounting as described 
below.
Licence and property acquisition costs
Exploration licence and leasehold property acquisition costs are capitalized within intangible assets and are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm 
that there is no indication that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under 
way or planned or that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine, that the discovery is economically viable based on a range of technical 
and commercial considerations, and sufficient progress is being made on establishing development plans and timing. If no future activity is planned, the 
remaining balance of the licence and property acquisition costs is written off. Lower value licences are pooled and amortized on a straight-line basis over 
the estimated period of exploration. Upon internal approval for development and recognition of proved or sanctioned probable reserves of oil and natural 
gas, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, plant and equipment.
Exploration and appraisal expenditure
Geological and geophysical exploration costs are recognized as an expense as incurred. Costs directly associated with an exploration well are initially 
capitalized as an intangible asset until the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated. These costs include employee remuneration, 
materials and fuel used, rig costs and payments made to contractors. If potentially commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are not found, the exploration 
well costs are written off. If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further appraisal activity, are likely to be capable of commercial development, the costs 
continue to be carried as an asset. If it is determined that development will not occur, that is, the efforts are not successful, then the costs are expensed.Financial statements
bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 149

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Costs directly associated with appraisal activity undertaken to determine the size, characteristics and commercial potential of a reservoir following the 
initial discovery of hydrocarbons, including the costs of appraisal wells where hydrocarbons were not found, are initially capitalized as an intangible asset. 
Upon internal approval for development and recognition of proved or sanctioned probable reserves, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, 
plant and equipment. If development is not approved and no further activity is expected to occur, then the costs are expensed.
The determination of whether potentially economic oil and natural gas reserves have been discovered by an exploration well is usually made within one 
year of well completion, but can take longer, depending on the complexity of the geological structure. Exploration wells that discover potentially economic 
quantities of oil and natural gas and are in areas where major capital expenditure (e.g. an offshore platform or a pipeline) would be required before 
production could begin, and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends on the successful completion of further exploration or 
appraisal work in the area, remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as such work is under way or firmly planned.
Significant judgement: exploration and appraisal intangible assets
Judgement is required to determine whether it is appropriate to continue to carry costs associated with exploration wells and exploratory-type 
stratigraphic test wells on the balance sheet. This includes costs relating to exploration licences or leasehold property acquisitions. It is not unusual to 
have such costs remaining suspended on the balance sheet for several years while additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and 
natural gas field is performed or while the optimum development plans and timing are established. The costs are carried based on the current regulatory 
and political environment or any known changes to that environment. All such carried costs are subject to regular technical, commercial and 
management review on at least an annual basis to confirm the continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value from, the discovery. Where this is 
no longer the case, the costs are immediately expensed.
The carrying amount of capitalized costs are included in Note 8.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment owned by the group is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The initial cost of 
an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into the location and condition necessary 
for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the initial estimate of any decommissioning obligation, if applicable, and, for 
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, directly attributable general or specific finance costs. The 
purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. 
Expenditure on major maintenance refits or repairs comprises the cost of replacement assets or parts of assets, inspection costs and overhaul costs. 
Where an asset or part of an asset that was separately depreciated is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item 
will flow to the group, the expenditure is capitalized and the carrying amount of the replaced asset is derecognized. Inspection costs associated with major 
maintenance programmes are capitalized and amortized over the period to the next inspection. Overhaul costs for major maintenance programmes, and 
all other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Expenditure on the construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of development wells, 
including service and unsuccessful development or delineation wells, is capitalized within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated from the 
commencement of production.
Oil and natural gas properties, including certain related pipelines, are depreciated using a unit-of-production method. The cost of producing wells is 
amortized over proved developed reserves. Licence acquisition, common facilities and future decommissioning costs are amortized over total proved 
reserves. The unit-of-production rate for the depreciation of common facilities takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together with estimated 
future capital expenditure expected to be incurred relating to as yet undeveloped reserves expected to be processed through these common facilities. 
Information on the carrying amounts of the group’s oil and natural gas properties, together with the amounts recognized in the income statement as 
depreciation, depletion and amortization is contained in Note 12 and Note 5 respectively.
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves determined in accordance with US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, including the 
application of prices using 12-month historical price data in assessing the commerciality of technical volumes, are typically used to calculate depreciation, 
depletion and amortization charges for the group’s oil and gas properties. Therefore, where this approach is adopted, charges are not dependent on 
management forecasts of future oil and gas prices.
The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortizing the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected 
future production.
The estimation of oil and natural gas reserves and bp’s process to manage reserves bookings is described in Supplementary information on oil and natural 
gas on page 223, which is unaudited. Details on bp’s proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes are provided on page 322. 
The 2024 movements in proved reserves are reflected in the tables showing movements in oil and natural gas reserves by region in Supplementary 
information on oil and natural gas (unaudited) on page 223.
Other property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life. The typical useful lives of the group’s other 
property, plant and equipment on initial recognition are as follows:
Land improvements 15 to 25 years
Buildings 20 to 50 years
Refineries 20 to 30 years
Pipelines 10 to 50 years
Service stations 15 years
Office equipment 3 to 10 years
Fixtures and fittings 5 to 15 years

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
The expected useful lives and depreciation method of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful 
lives or the depreciation method are accounted for prospectively. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no 
future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the income statement in the period in which the item 
is derecognized.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and equity-accounted entities
The group assesses assets or groups of assets, called cash-generating units (CGUs), for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or CGU may not be recoverable; for example, changes in the group’s business plans, plans to dispose rather 
than retain assets, changes in the group’s assumptions about discount rates, commodity prices, low plant utilization, evidence of physical damage or, for 
oil and gas assets, significant downward revisions of estimated reserves or increases in estimated future development expenditure or decommissioning 
costs. If any such indication of impairment exists, the group makes an estimate of the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. Individual assets are grouped 
into CGUs for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash 
inflows of other groups of assets. A CGU’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If it is probable that 
the value of the CGU will be primarily recovered through a disposal transaction, the expected disposal proceeds are considered in determining the 
recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the CGU is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount.
The business segment plans, which are approved on an annual basis by senior management, are the primary source of information for the determination 
of value in use. They contain forecasts for oil and natural gas production, power generation, refinery throughputs, sales volumes for various types of 
refined products (e.g. gasoline and lubricants), revenues, costs and capital expenditure. Carbon taxes and costs of emissions allowances are included in 
estimates of future cash flows, where applicable, based on the regulatory environment in each jurisdiction in which the group operates. As an initial step in 
the preparation of these plans, various assumptions regarding market conditions, such as oil prices, natural gas prices, power prices, refining margins, 
refined product margins and cost inflation rates are set by senior management. These assumptions take account of existing prices, global supply-demand 
equilibrium for oil and natural gas, other macroeconomic factors and historical trends and variability. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset group to the extent that they are not already reflected in the discount rate and are discounted to their 
present value typically using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Fair value less costs of disposal is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants and does not 
reflect the effects of factors that may be specific to the group and not applicable to entities in general. Fair value may be determined by reference to 
agreed or expected sales proceeds, recent market transactions for similar assets or using discounted cash flow analyses. Where discounted cash flow 
analyses are used to calculate fair value less costs of disposal, estimates are made about the assumptions market participants would use when pricing 
the asset, CGU or group of CGUs containing goodwill and the test is performed on a post-tax basis.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or 
may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there 
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s or CGU's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. If that is 
the case, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the lower of its recoverable amount and the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or CGU in prior years. Impairment reversals are recognized in profit 
or loss. After a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s or CGU's revised carrying amount, less any residual 
value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the recoverable amount of the group of 
CGUs to which the goodwill relates should be assessed. In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the group of CGUs to 
which goodwill has been allocated is compared with its recoverable amount. Where the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs is less than the carrying 
amount (including goodwill), an impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
The group assesses investments in equity-accounted entities for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired, after 
recognizing its share of any losses of the equity-accounted entity itself. If any such objective evidence of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the 
investment is compared with its recoverable amount, being the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. If the carrying amount 
exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.
Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values
Determination as to whether, and by how much, an asset, CGU, or group of CGUs containing goodwill is impaired involves management estimates on 
highly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount rates, capital expenditure, carbon pricing (where 
applicable), production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-
demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, power and refined products. Judgement is required when determining the appropriate grouping of assets 
into a CGU or the appropriate grouping of CGUs for impairment testing purposes. For example, individual oil and gas properties may form separate CGUs 
whilst certain oil and gas properties with shared infrastructure may be grouped together to form a single CGU. Alternative groupings of assets or CGUs 
may result in a different outcome from impairment testing. See Note 14 for details on how these groupings have been determined in relation to the 
impairment testing of goodwill.
As described above, the recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of 
disposal may be determined based on expected sales proceeds or similar recent market transaction data.
Details of impairment charges and reversals recognized in the income statement are provided in Note 4 and details on the carrying amounts of assets 
are shown in Note 12, Note 14 and Note 15.
The estimates for assumptions made in impairment tests in 2024 relating to discount rates and oil and gas properties are discussed below. Changes in 
the economic environment including as a result of the energy transition or other facts and circumstances may necessitate revisions to these 
assumptions and could result in a material change to the carrying values of the group's assets within the next financial year.Financial statements

Discount rates
For discounted cash flow calculations, future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the CGU. Value-in-use calculations are typically discounted 
using a pre-tax discount rate based upon the cost of funding the group derived from an established model, adjusted to a pre-tax basis and incorporating a 
market participant capital structure and country risk premiums. Fair value less costs of disposal discounted cash flow calculations use a post-tax 
discount rate.
The discount rates applied in impairment tests are reassessed each year and, in 2024, the post-tax discount rate was 8% (2023 8%) other than for 
renewable power assets. Where the CGU is located in a country that was judged to be higher risk, an additional premium of 1% to 3% was reflected in the 
post-tax discount rate (2023 1% to 4%). The judgement of classifying a country as higher risk and the applicable premium takes into account various 
economic and geopolitical factors. The pre-tax discount rate, other than for renewable power assets, typically ranged from 9% to 20% (2023 9% to 20%) 
depending on the risk premium and applicable tax rate in the geographic location of the CGU. For renewable power assets, which were tested primarily 
on a fair-value basis in 2024 (including those in equity accounted entities) tests were performed using a post-tax cost of equity-based discount rate range 
of 8.75% to 9.5%. In 2023, tests were performed on a value-in-use basis using a post-tax WACC-based discount rate of 6.5%.
Oil and natural gas properties
For oil and natural gas properties in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments, expected future cash flows are estimated 
using management’s best estimate of future oil and natural gas prices, production and reserves and certain resources volumes. Forecast cash flows 
include the impact of all approved emission reduction projects. The estimated future level of production in all impairment tests is based on assumptions 
about future commodity prices, production and development costs, field decline rates, current fiscal regimes and other factors.
In 2024, the group identified oil and gas properties in these segments with carrying amounts totalling $17,853 million (2023 $18,374 million) where the 
headroom, based on the most recent impairment test performed in the year on those assets, was less than or equal to 20% of the carrying value. A 
change in the discount rate, reserves, resources or the oil and gas price assumptions in the next financial year may result in a recoverable amount of one 
or more of these assets above or below the current carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in that period. 
Management considers that reasonably possible changes in the discount rate or forecast revenue, arising from a change in oil and natural gas prices 
and/or production could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year, see Sensitivity analyses, below.
The recoverability of intangible exploration and appraisal expenditure is covered under Oil and natural gas exploration, appraisal and development 
expenditure above.
Oil and natural gas prices
The price assumptions used for value-in-use impairment testing are based on those used for investment appraisal. bp’s carbon emissions cost 
assumptions and their interrelationship with oil and gas prices are described in 'Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate 
change and the transition to a lower carbon economy' on page 145. The investment appraisal price assumptions are recommended by the senior vice 
president economic & energy insights after considering a range of external price sets, and supply and demand profiles associated with various energy 
transition scenarios. They are reviewed and approved by management. As a result of the current uncertainty over the pace of transition to lower-carbon 
supply and demand and the social, political and environmental actions that will be taken to meet the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, the 
scenarios considered include those where those goals are met as well as those where they are not met. 
During the year, bp's price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing were revised. The revised price assumptions have been rebased in real 
2023 terms and are materially consistent with the disclosed prices in real 2022 terms. The near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per 
barrel to reflect near term supply constraints before declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy 
system decarbonizes, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00 
per mmBtu reflecting an assumption that declining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. These price assumptions are derived 
from the central case investment appraisal assumptions (see page 20). A summary of the group’s revised price assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub 
gas, applied in 2024 and 2023, in real 2023 terms, is provided below. The assumptions represent management’s best estimate of future prices at the 
balance sheet date, which sit within the range of external scenarios considered as appropriate for the purpose. They are considered by bp to be in line 
with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average 
temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 
However, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. Inflation rate of 2% - 2.5% (2023 2%) is applied to determine the price 
assumptions in nominal terms.
The majority of bp’s reserves and resources that support the carrying value of the group’s existing oil and gas properties are expected to be produced 
over the next 12 years. 
The recoverability of deferred tax assets is also affected by the group’s oil and natural gas price assumptions as these could impact the estimate of 
future taxable profits. See Note 9 for further information.

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Global oil production increased by 1.4% in 2024 with this growth predominantly coming from non-OPEC countries as OPEC+ continued its output 
reductions. Global oil demand growth slowed, increasing by 0.9% in 2024 as we leave the post-Covid recovery period and Chinese demand fell short of 
forecasts. Brent dropped by nearly $2 per barrel in 2024 in response to lacklustre demand growth and increasing supply. While geopolitical risk (e.g., 
tariffs, sanctions) may support prices in the short-term, bp's long-term assumption for oil prices is lower than the 2024 average as oil demand is likely to 
fall such that the price levels needed to encourage sufficient investment to meet global oil demand will also be lower.
US Henry Hub spot prices averaged $2.2/mmBtu in 2024 from $2.5/mmBtu in 2023. Prices fell further in order to reduce output and stimulate demand in 
the power sector. Milder than normal winter weather during winter 2023/2024 left US gas storage levels over 20% above historic average levels at the end 
of winter 2023/2024, causing prices to fall below $2/mmBtu. Meanwhile, after growing by 4 Bcf/d in 2023, low prices caused natural gas production to 
fall by 0.4 Bcf/d in 2024, helping to bring the market back into balance. The level of US gas prices in 2024 was below bp’s long term price assumption 
based on the judgment of the price level required to incentivize new production. 
Oil and natural gas reserves
In addition to oil and natural gas prices, significant technical and commercial assessments are required to determine the group’s estimated oil and 
natural gas reserves. Reserves estimates are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, 
reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity and drilling of new wells all impact on the determination of the group’s estimates of its oil 
and natural gas reserves. bp bases its reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial 
assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements. 
Reserves assumptions for value-in-use tests reflect the reserves and resources that management currently intend to develop. The recoverable amount of 
oil and gas properties is determined using a combination of inputs including reserves, resources and production volumes. Risk factors may be applied to 
reserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved or probable.
Sensitivity analyses
Management considers discount rates, oil and natural gas prices and production to be the key sources of estimation uncertainty in determining the 
recoverable amount of upstream oil and gas assets. The sensitivity analyses below, in addition to covering the key sources of estimation uncertainty, also 
indicate how the energy transition, potential future carbon emissions costs for operational GHG emissions and/or reduced demand for oil and gas may 
further impact forecast revenue cash inflows to a greater extent than currently anticipated in the group’s value-in-use estimates for oil and gas CGUs, if 
carbon emissions costs were to be implemented as a deduction against revenue cash flows. The analyses therefore represent a net revenue sensitivity. 
A change in net revenue from upstream oil and gas properties can arise either due to changes in oil and natural gas prices, carbon emissions costs/
carbon prices, changes in oil and natural gas production, or a combination of these.
Management tested the impact of changes in net revenue cash flows in value-in-use impairment testing under the following sensitivity analyses: an 
increase in net revenues of 8% in all years up to 2040, and 25% in all remaining years to 2050; and a decrease in net revenues of 20% in all years up to 
2030, 35% in all subsequent years to 2040 and 50% in all remaining years to 2050.
Net revenue reductions of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to a reduction in the carrying amount of bp’s currently held upstream oil and 
gas properties in the range of $19-20 billion which is approximately 30% of the associated net book value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 
December 2024. If this net revenue reduction was due to reductions in prices in isolation, it reflects an indicative decrease in the carrying amount of using 
price assumptions for Brent oil trending broadly towards the bottom of the range of prices associated with the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD) 'family' of scenarios considered to be consistent with limiting global average temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 
This ‘family’ of scenarios is also used in bp's TCFD scenario analysis (see page 42).
Net revenue increases of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to an increase in the carrying amount of bp’s currently held upstream oil and 
gas properties in the range of $1-2 billion  which is approximately 2-3% of the associated net book value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 
December 2024. This potential increase in the carrying amount would arise due to reversals of previously recognized impairments and represents 
approximately one fifth of the total impairment reversal capacity available at 31 December 2024. If this net revenue increase was due to increases in 
prices in isolation, it reflects an indicative increase in the carrying amount of using price assumptions for Brent oil trending broadly towards the top end 
until 2040, and then towards the mean average at 2050, of the range of prices associated with the WBCSD 'family' of scenarios considered to be 
consistent with limiting global average temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This ‘family’ of scenarios is also used in bp's TCFD scenario 
analysis.
These sensitivity analyses do not, however, represent management’s best estimate of any impairment charges or reversals that might be recognized as 
they do not fully incorporate consequential changes that may arise, such as changes in costs and business plans and phasing of development. For 
example, costs across the industry are more likely to decrease as oil and natural gas prices fall. The analyses also assume the impact of increases in 
carbon price on operational GHG emissions are fully absorbed as a decrease in net revenue (and vice versa) rather than reflecting how carbon prices or 
other carbon emissions costs may ultimately be incorporated by the market. The above sensitivity analyses therefore do not reflect a linear relationship 
between net revenue and value that can be extrapolated. The interdependency of these inputs and factors plus the diverse characteristics of the group's 
upstream oil and gas properties limits the practicability of estimating the probability or extent to which the overall recoverable amount is impacted by 
changes to the price assumptions or production volumes.
Management also tested the impact of a one percentage point change in the discount rate used for value-in-use impairment testing of upstream oil and 
gas properties. This level of change reflects past experience of a reasonable change in rate that could arise within the next financial year. If the discount 
rate was one percentage point higher across all tests performed, the net impairment loss recognized in 2024 would have been approximately $0.2 billion 
higher. If the discount rate was one percentage point lower, the net impairment loss recognized would have been approximately $0.5 billion lower.Financial statements

Management considers refining margins to be the key source of estimation uncertainty in determining the recoverable amount of refinery assets. The 
sensitivity analysis below, in addition to covering the key sources of estimation uncertainty, also indicates how the energy transition and/or reduced 
demand for refined products may further impact forecast cash inflows to a greater extent than currently anticipated in the group’s value-in-use estimates 
for refinery CGUs. 
Management tested the impact of a $1/barrel decrease in each refinery’s future margin assumption in all years of the value-in-use estimate. A reduction 
of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to a reduction in the carrying amount of bp’s currently held refining property, plant and equipment in 
the range of $1-2 billion.
This sensitivity analysis does not, however, represent management’s best estimate of any impairment charges that might be recognized as it does not 
fully incorporate consequential changes that may arise, such as changes in costs and business plans and crude or product slates. The above sensitivity 
analysis therefore does not reflect a linear relationship between margins and value that can be extrapolated. The interdependency of these inputs and 
factors plus the varying configurations of the group's refineries limits the practicability of estimating the probability or extent to which the overall 
recoverable amount is impacted by changes to the margin assumptions.
Goodwill
Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, bp is required to test annually for impairment of goodwill acquired in business 
combinations. The group carries goodwill of $14.9 billion on its balance sheet (2023 $12.5 billion), principally relating to the Atlantic Richfield, Burmah 
Castrol, Devon Energy, Reliance and Lightsource bp transactions. Of this, $7.2 billion relates to goodwill in the oil production & operations segment and to 
hydrocarbon CGUs within the gas & low carbon energy segment (2023 $7.0 billion), for which oil and gas price and production assumptions are key 
sources of estimation uncertainty. Sensitivities and additional information relating to impairment testing of goodwill in these segments are provided in 
Note 14. 
Inventories
Inventories, other than inventories held for short-term trading purposes, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is typically determined 
by the first-in first-out method and comprises direct purchase costs, cost of production, transportation and manufacturing expenses. Net realizable value 
is determined by reference to prices existing at the balance sheet date, adjusted where the sale of inventories after the reporting period gives evidence 
about their net realizable value at the end of the period.
Inventories held for short-term trading purposes are stated at fair value less costs to sell and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income 
statement.
Supplies are valued at the lower of cost on a weighted-average basis and net realizable value.
Leases
Agreements that convey the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration are accounted for as leases. 
The right to control is conveyed if bp has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from, and the right to direct the use of, the 
identified asset throughout the period of use. An asset is identified if it is explicitly or implicitly specified by the agreement and any substitution rights held 
by the lessor over the asset are not considered substantive. 
Agreements that convey the right to control the use of an intangible asset including rights to explore for or use hydrocarbons are not accounted for as 
leases. See material accounting policy information: intangible assets.
A lease liability is recognized on the balance sheet on the lease commencement date at the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. 
The discount rate applied is the rate implicit in the lease if readily determinable, otherwise an incremental borrowing rate is used. For the majority of the 
leases in the group, there is not sufficient information available to readily determine the rate implicit in the lease, and therefore the incremental borrowing 
rate is used. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on factors such as the group’s cost of borrowing, lessee legal entity credit risk, currency 
and lease term. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of a lease together with any periods covered by an extension option that bp is reasonably 
certain to exercise, or periods covered by a termination option that bp is reasonably certain not to exercise. The future lease payments included in the 
present value calculation are any fixed payments, payments that vary depending on an index or rate, payments due for the reasonably certain exercise of 
options and expected residual value guarantee payments. Repayments of principal are presented as financing cash flows and payments of interest are 
presented as operating cash flows.
Payments that vary based on factors other than an index or a rate such as usage, sales volumes or revenues are not included in the present value 
calculation and are recognized in the income statement and presented as operating cash flows. The lease liability is recognized on an amortized cost basis 
with interest expense recognized in the income statement over the lease term, except for where capitalized as exploration, appraisal or development 
expenditure.
The right-of-use asset is recognized on the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment at a value equivalent to the initial measurement of the lease 
liability adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives, initial direct costs and any restoration obligations. The right-of-use asset is depreciated typically 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciation charge is recognized in the income statement except for where capitalized as exploration, 
appraisal or development expenditure. Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment in line with the accounting policy for impairment of property, plant 
and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill. 
Agreements may include both lease and non-lease components. Payments for lease and non-lease components are allocated on a relative stand-alone 
selling price basis except for leases of retail service stations where the group has elected not to separate non-lease payments from the calculation of the 
lease liability and right-of-use asset.
If the lease term at commencement of the agreement is less than 12 months, a lease liability and right-of-use asset are not recognized, and a lease 
expense is recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis.

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
If a significant event or change in circumstances, within the control of bp, arises that affects the reasonably certain lease term or there are changes to the 
lease payments, the present value of the lease liability is remeasured using the revised term and payments, with the right-of-use asset adjusted by an 
equivalent amount. 
Modifications to a lease agreement beyond the original terms and conditions are accounted for as a re-measurement of the lease liability with a 
corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Any gain or loss on modification is recognized in the income statement. Modifications that increase 
the scope of the lease at a price commensurate with the stand-alone selling price are accounted for as a separate new lease.
The group recognizes the full lease liability, rather than its working interest share, for leases entered into on behalf of a joint operation if the group has the 
primary responsibility for making the lease payments. This may be the case if for example bp, as operator of the joint operation, is the sole signatory to the 
lease agreement. In such cases, bp’s working interest share of the right-of-use asset is recognized if it is jointly controlled by the group and the other joint 
operators, and a receivable is recognized for the share of the asset transferred to the other joint operators. If bp is a non-operator, a payable to the operator 
is recognized if they have the primary responsibility for making the lease payments and bp has joint control over the right-of-use asset, otherwise no 
balances are recognized.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. In the case of financial assets not measured at fair value through 
profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs are also included. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as 
set out below. The group derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the rights to receive cash flows have been 
transferred to a third party and either substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred, or substantially all the risks and rewards 
of the asset have neither been retained nor transferred but control of the asset has been transferred. This includes the derecognition of receivables for 
which discounting arrangements are entered into.
The group classifies its financial asset debt instruments as measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value 
through profit or loss. The classification depends on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of 
the financial asset.
Financial assets measured at amortized cost
Financial assets are classified as measured at amortized cost when they are held in a business model the objective of which is to collect contractual cash 
flows and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Such assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective 
interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the assets are derecognized or impaired 
and when interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. This category of financial assets includes trade and other receivables.
Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Financial assets are classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income when they are held in a business model the objective of 
which is both to collect contractual cash flows and sell the financial assets, and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and 
interest. 
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss when the asset does not meet the criteria to be measured at amortized cost 
or fair value through other comprehensive income. Such assets are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income 
statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are included in this category.
Investments in equity instruments
Investments in equity instruments are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss unless an election is made on an instrument-by-
instrument basis to recognize fair value gains and losses in other comprehensive income.
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The treatment of gains and losses 
arising from revaluation is described below in the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.
Cash equivalents
Cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and generally have a maturity of three months or less from the 
date of acquisition. Cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost or, in the case of certain money market funds, fair value 
through profit or loss.
Impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost
The group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with financial assets measured at amortized cost at each balance 
sheet date. Expected credit losses are measured based on the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk. As lifetime 
expected credit losses are recognized for trade receivables and the tenor of substantially all other in-scope financial assets is less than 12 months there is 
no significant difference between the measurement of 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses for the group. The measurement of expected credit 
losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. The expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the future cash flows the group expects to receive discounted at the financial asset’s original effective 
interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is adjusted, with the amount of the impairment gain or loss recognized in the income statement.
A financial asset or group of financial assets classified as measured at amortized cost is considered to be credit-impaired if there is reasonable and 
supportable evidence that one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset (or group of 
financial assets) have occurred. Financial assets are written off where the group has no reasonable expectation of recovering amounts due.
Equity instruments
Instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements. Instruments that 
cannot be settled in the group’s own equity instruments and that include no contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange 
financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity that are potentially unfavourable are classified as equity. Equity instruments issued by the group 
are recognized at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable issue costs.Financial statements

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are recognized when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The group derecognizes financial 
liabilities when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their 
classification, as follows:
Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities that meet the definition of held for trading are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities are carried on 
the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging 
instruments, are included in this category.
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The treatment of gains and losses 
arising from revaluation is described below in the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
All other financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this 
is typically equivalent to the fair value of the proceeds received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is 
calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or 
cancellation of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.
This category of financial liabilities includes trade and other payables and finance debt.
Significant judgement: supplier financing arrangements
The group’s trade payables include some supplier financing arrangements that utilize letter of credit facilities, promissory notes and reverse factoring. 
Judgement is required to assess the payables subject to these arrangements to determine whether they should continue to be classified as trade 
payables and give rise to operating cash flows or finance debt and financing cash flows. The criteria used in making this assessment include the 
payment terms for the amount due relative to terms commonly seen in the markets in which bp operates and whether the arrangements significantly 
change the nature of the liability. Liabilities subject to these arrangements with payment terms of up to approximately 60 days are generally considered 
to be trade payables and give rise to operating cash flows. See Note 29 - Liquidity risk for further information.
Financial guarantees
The group issues financial guarantee contracts to make specified payments to reimburse holders for losses incurred if certain associates, joint ventures or 
third-party entities fail to make payments when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument such as a loan. The liability for a 
financial guarantee contract is initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of the contract’s estimated expected credit loss 
and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, cumulative amortization.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The group uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and 
commodity prices, as well as for trading purposes. These derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value on the date on which a 
derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as 
liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item (for example, oil, oil products, gas or power) that can be settled net in cash, with the exception of contracts 
that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the group’s expected 
purchase, sale or usage requirements, are accounted for as financial instruments. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that 
are not designated as effective hedging instruments are recognized in the income statement. 
If, at inception of a contract, the valuation cannot be supported by observable market data, any gain or loss determined by the valuation methodology is 
not recognized in the income statement but is deferred on the balance sheet and is commonly known as a ‘day-one gain or loss’. This deferred gain or loss 
is recognized in the income statement over the life of the contract until substantially all the remaining contractual cash flows can be valued using 
observable market data at which point any remaining deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. Changes in valuation subsequent to the 
initial valuation at inception of a contract are recognized immediately in the income statement.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:
•Fair value hedges when hedging exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability.
•Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to either a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or 
liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Hedge relationships are formally designated and documented at inception, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the 
hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, the 
existence at inception of an economic relationship and subsequent measurement of the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to 
changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the hedge ratio and sources of hedge ineffectiveness. Hedges 
meeting the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:
Fair value hedges
The change in fair value of a hedging derivative is recognized in profit or loss. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being 
hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognized in profit or loss, where it offsets. The group applies fair value 
hedge accounting when hedging interest rate risk and certain currency risks on fixed rate finance debt.
Fair value hedge accounting is discontinued only when the hedging relationship or a part thereof ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. This includes when 
the risk management objective changes or when the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised. The accumulated adjustment to the carrying 
amount of a hedged item at such time is then amortized prospectively to profit or loss as finance interest expense over the hedged item's remaining period 
to maturity.

Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedging instrument is reported in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is 
recognized in profit or loss. Amounts reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement when the hedged transaction 
affects profit or loss.
Where the hedged item is a highly probable forecast transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, such as a forecast 
foreign currency transaction for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, the amounts recognized within other comprehensive income are 
transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. Where the hedged item is an equity investment, the amounts recognized in 
other comprehensive income remain in the separate component of equity until the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss or when accounting under the 
equity method is discontinued. Where the hedged item is recognized directly in profit or loss, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are 
reclassified to production and manufacturing expenses or sales and other operating revenues as appropriate.
Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued only when the hedging relationship or a part thereof ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. This includes when 
the designated hedged forecast transaction or part thereof is no longer considered to be highly probable to occur, or when the hedging instrument is sold, 
terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover. When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued amounts previously recognized within other 
comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to the initial carrying 
amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognized within other 
comprehensive income will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss.
Costs of hedging
The foreign currency basis spread of cross-currency interest rate swaps are excluded from hedge designations and accounted for as costs of hedging. 
Changes in fair value of the foreign currency basis spread are recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that they relate to the hedged item. 
For time-period related hedged items, the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is amortized to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the 
term of the hedging relationship. 
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The group 
categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three levels depending on the ability to observe inputs employed in their measurement. 
Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, 
other than quoted prices included within level 1 for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant 
modifications to observable related market data or bp’s assumptions about pricing by market participants.
Significant estimate and judgement: derivative financial instruments
In some cases the fair values of derivatives are estimated using internal models due to the absence of quoted prices or other observable, market-
corroborated data. This primarily applies to the group’s longer-term derivative contracts. The majority of these contracts are valued using models with 
inputs that include price curves for each of the different products that are built up from available active market pricing data (including volatility and 
correlation) and modelled using the maximum available external information. Additionally, where limited data exists for certain products, prices are 
determined using historical and long-term pricing relationships. The use of alternative assumptions or valuation methodologies may result in significantly 
different values for these derivatives. A reasonably possible change in the price assumptions used in the models relating to index price would not have a 
material impact on net assets and the Group income statement primarily as a result of offsetting movements between derivative assets and liabilities. 
In some cases, judgement is required to determine whether contracts to buy or sell commodities meet the definition of a derivative or to determine 
appropriate presentation and classification of transactions in certain cases. In particular, contracts to buy and sell LNG are not considered to meet the 
definition as they are not considered capable of being net settled due to a lack of liquidity in the LNG market and the inability or lack of history of net 
settlement and are accounted for on an accruals basis, rather than as a derivative. Under IFRS, bp fair values the derivative financial instruments used to 
risk-manage the LNG contracts themselves, resulting in a measurement mismatch.
For more information, including the carrying amounts of level 3 derivatives, see Note 30.
Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are presented gross in the balance sheet unless both of the following criteria are met: the group currently has a legally 
enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts; and the group intends to either settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. A right of set off is the group’s legal right to settle an amount payable to a creditor by applying against it an amount receivable from the 
same counterparty. The relevant legal jurisdiction and laws applicable to the relationships between the parties are considered when assessing whether a 
current legally enforceable right to set off exists.
Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are recognized when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Where appropriate, the future cash flow estimates are adjusted to reflect risks specific to the liability.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is 
recognized within finance costs. Provisions are discounted using a nominal discount rate of 4.5% (2023 4%). 
Provisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date (current) and amounts expected to be settled 
later (non-current).
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will only be confirmed by future events not wholly within the control of the group, or present 
obligations where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient 
reliability. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements but are disclosed, if material, unless the possibility of an outflow 
of economic resources is considered remote.Financial statements

Decommissioning
Liabilities for decommissioning costs are recognized when the group has an obligation to plug and abandon a well, dismantle and remove a facility or an 
item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reliable estimate of that liability can be made. Where an obligation exists for a new 
facility or item of plant, such as oil and natural gas production or transportation facilities, this liability will be recognized on construction or installation. 
Similarly, where an obligation exists for a well, this liability is recognized when it is drilled. An obligation for decommissioning may also crystallize during 
the period of operation of a well, facility or item of plant through a change in legislation or through a decision to terminate operations; an obligation may 
also arise in cases where an asset has been sold but the subsequent owner is no longer able to fulfil its decommissioning obligations, for example due to 
bankruptcy. The amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and 
requirements. The provision for the costs of decommissioning wells, production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives is estimated 
using existing technology, at future prices, depending on the expected timing of the activity, and discounted using a nominal discount rate. 
An amount equivalent to the decommissioning provision is recognized as part of the corresponding intangible asset (in the case of an exploration or 
appraisal well) or property, plant and equipment. The decommissioning portion of the property, plant and equipment is subsequently depreciated at the 
same rate as the rest of the asset. Other than the unwinding of discount on or utilization of the provision, any change in the present value of the estimated 
expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the corresponding asset where that asset is generating or is expected to generate future 
economic benefits.
Environmental expenditures and liabilities
Environmental expenditures that are required in order for the group to obtain future economic benefits from its assets are capitalized as part of those 
assets. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future earnings are expensed.
Liabilities for environmental costs are recognized when a clean-up is probable and the associated costs can be reliably estimated. Generally, the timing of 
recognition of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.
The amount recognized is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. Provisions for environmental liabilities have been 
estimated using existing technology, at future prices and discounted using a nominal discount rate. 
Emissions 
Liabilities for emissions are recognized when the cumulative volumes of gases emitted by the group at the end of the reporting period exceed the 
allowances granted free of charge held for own use or a set baseline for emissions. The provision is measured at the best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. It is based on the excess of actual emissions over the free allowances held or set 
baseline in tonnes (or other appropriate quantity) and is valued at the actual cost of any allowances that have been purchased and held for own use on a 
first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis, and, if insufficient allowances are held, for the remaining requirement on the basis of the spot market price of allowances at 
the balance sheet date. The majority of these provisions are typically settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date however certain schemes may 
have longer compliance periods. The cost of allowances purchased to cover a shortfall is recognized separately on the balance sheet as an intangible 
asset unless the emission allowances acquired or generated by the group are risk-managed by the trading and shipping function, then they are recognized 
on the balance sheet as inventory.
Restructuring provisions
Restructuring provisions are recognized where a detailed formal plan exists, and a valid expectation of risk of redundancy has been made to those affected 
but where the specific outcomes remain uncertain. Where formal redundancy offers have been made, the obligations for those amounts are reported as 
payables and, if not, as provisions if unpaid at the year-end.

Significant judgements and estimates: provisions
The group holds provisions for the future decommissioning of oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives. 
The largest decommissioning obligations facing bp relate to the plugging and abandonment of wells and the removal and disposal of oil and natural gas 
platforms and pipelines around the world. Most of these decommissioning events are many years in the future and the precise requirements that will 
have to be met when the removal event occurs are uncertain. Decommissioning technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are political, 
environmental, safety and public expectations. The timing and amounts of future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainty and estimation is 
required in determining the amounts of provisions to be recognized. Any changes in the expected future costs are reflected in both the provision and, 
where still recognized, the asset. 
If oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties, judgement is required to assess whether the new owner will be unable to 
meet their decommissioning obligations, whether bp would then be responsible for decommissioning, and if so the extent of that responsibility. This 
typically requires assessment of the local legal requirements and the financial standing of the owner. If the standing deteriorates significantly, for 
example, bankruptcy of the owner, a provision may be required. The group has $0.7 billion of decommissioning provisions recognized as at 31 December 
2024 (2023 $0.6 billion) for assets previously sold to third parties where the sale transferred the decommissioning obligation to the new owner. See Note 
33 for further information.
Decommissioning provisions associated with refineries are generally not recognized, as the potential obligations cannot be measured, given their 
indeterminate settlement dates. Obligations may arise if refineries cease manufacturing operations and any such obligations would be recognized in the 
period when sufficient information becomes available to determine potential settlement dates. See Note 33 for further information.
The group performs periodic reviews of its refineries for any changes in facts and circumstances including those relating to the energy transition, that 
might require the recognition of a decommissioning provision. Portfolio strength and flexibility are such that the point of cessation of manufacturing at 
the group’s operating refineries is not yet expected within a determinate time period, as existing property plant and equipment is expected to be renewed 
or replaced.
The provision for environmental liabilities is estimated based on current legal and constructive requirements, technology, price levels and expected plans 
for remediation. Actual costs and cash outflows can differ from current estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, public expectations, 
prices, discovery and analysis of site conditions and changes in clean-up technology. 
The timing and amount of future expenditures relating to decommissioning and environmental liabilities are reviewed annually. The interest rate used in 
discounting the cash flows is reviewed quarterly. The nominal interest rate used to determine the balance sheet obligations at the end of 2024 was 4.5%  
(2023 4%), which was based on long-dated US government bonds interpolated to reflect the expected weighted average time to decommissioning. The 
weighted average period over which decommissioning and environmental costs are generally expected to be incurred is estimated to be approximately 
17 years (2023 17 years) and 7 years (2023 6 years) respectively. Costs at future prices are typically determined by applying an inflation rate of 1.5% 
(2023 1.5%) to decommissioning costs and 2% (2023 2%) for all other provisions. A lower rate is typically applied to decommissioning as certain costs 
are expected to remain fixed at current or past prices.
The estimated phasing of undiscounted cash flows in real terms for upstream decommissioning is approximately $5.5 billion (2023 $5.5 billion) within 
the next 10 years, $6.2 billion (2023 $5.8 billion) in 10 to 20 years and the remainder of approximately $6.7 billion (2023 $6.6 billion) after 20 years. The 
timing and amount of decommissioning cash flows are inherently uncertain and therefore the phasing is management’s current best estimate but may 
not be what will ultimately occur.
Further information about the group’s provisions is provided in Note 23. Changes in assumptions in relation to the group's provisions could result in a 
material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the nominal discount rate applied could 
decrease the group’s provision balances by approximately $1.5 billion (2023 $1.6 billion). The pre-tax impact on the group income statement would be a 
credit of approximately $0.4 billion (2023 $0.4 billion). This level of change reflects past experience of a reasonable change in rate that could arise within 
the next financial year.
The discounting impact on the group's decommissioning provisions for oil and gas properties in the oil productions & operations and gas & low carbon 
energy segments of a two-year change in the timing of expected future decommissioning expenditures is approximately $0.3 billion (2023 $0.6 billion). 
Management currently does not consider a change of greater than two years to be reasonably possible in the next financial year and therefore the timing 
of upstream decommissioning expenditure is not a key source of estimation uncertainty.
If all expected future decommissioning expenditures were 10% higher, then these decommissioning provisions would increase by approximately $1.2 
billion (2023 $1.1 billion) and a pre-tax charge of approximately $0.4 billion (2023 $0.2 billion) would be recognized. A one percentage point increase in 
the inflation rate applied to upstream decommissioning costs to determine the nominal cash flows could increase the decommissioning provision by 
approximately $1.7 billion (2023 $1.9 billion) with a pre-tax charge of approximately $0.5 billion (2023 $0.5 billion).
As described in Note 33, the group is subject to claims and actions for which no provisions have been recognized. The facts and circumstances relating 
to particular cases are evaluated regularly in determining whether a provision relating to a specific litigation should be recognized or revised. Accordingly, 
significant management judgement relating to provisions and contingent liabilities is required, since the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict. 
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are 
rendered by employees of the group. Deferred bonus arrangements that have a vesting date more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are valued 
on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period until the award vests. The 
material accounting policy information for pensions and other post-employment benefits are described below.Financial statements
bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 159

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The cost of providing benefits under the group’s defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which 
attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation. Past service costs, resulting from either a plan amendment or a curtailment (a reduction in future obligations as a result 
of a material reduction in the plan membership), are recognized immediately when the company becomes committed to a change.
Net interest expense relating to pensions and other post-employment benefits, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in 
present value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the 
present value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected 
changes in the obligation or plan assets during the year. 
Remeasurements of the defined benefit liability and asset, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts 
included in net interest described above) are recognized within other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently 
reclassified to profit and loss.
The defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit recognized on the balance sheet for each plan comprises the difference between the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds) and the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations 
are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. Defined benefit 
pension plan surpluses are only recognized to the extent they are recoverable, either by way of a refund from the plan or reductions in future contributions 
to the plan.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.
Significant estimate: pensions and other post-employment benefits
Accounting for defined benefit pensions and other post-employment benefits involves making significant estimates when measuring the group's pension 
plan surpluses and deficits. These estimates require assumptions to be made about many uncertainties.
Pensions and other post-employment benefit assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year. These assumptions are used to 
determine the projected benefit obligation at the year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the group's balance sheet and pension and 
other post-employment benefit expense for the following year.
The assumptions that are the most significant to the amounts reported are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality levels. Assumptions about these 
variables are based on the environment in each country. The assumptions used vary from year to year, with resultant effects on future net income and 
net assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying 
amounts of the group's pension and other post-employment benefit obligations within the next financial year. Any differences between these 
assumptions and the actual outcome will also affect future net income and net assets.
The values ascribed to these assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation 
used are provided in Note 24.
Income taxes
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. 
Income tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it is determined 
in accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities. It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or 
deductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except:
•Where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of goodwill.
•Where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, at the time of 
the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and, at the time of the transaction, does not give rise to equal taxable and 
deductible temporary differences.
•In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, where the 
group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused 
tax losses can be utilized, except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset 
or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and, 
at the time of the transaction, does not give rise to equal taxable and deductive temporary differences. 
In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, deferred tax 
assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be 
available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable or increased to 
the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. 
160 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not 
discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different 
taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously.
Where tax treatments are uncertain, if it is considered probable that a taxation authority will accept the group's proposed tax treatment, income taxes are 
recognized consistent with the group's income tax filings. If it is not considered probable, the uncertainty is reflected within the carrying amount of the 
applicable tax asset or liability using either the most likely amount or an expected value, depending on which method better predicts the resolution of the 
uncertainty.
The computation of the group’s income tax expense and liability involves the interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions 
throughout the world. The resolution of tax positions taken by the group, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, can take 
several years to complete and in some cases it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome. Therefore, judgement is required to determine whether 
provisions for income taxes are required and, if so, estimation is required of the amounts that could be payable.
In addition, the group has carry-forward tax losses and tax credits in certain taxing jurisdictions that are available to offset against future taxable profit. 
However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or 
tax credits can be utilized. Management judgement is exercised in assessing whether this is the case and estimates are required to be made of the 
amount of future taxable profits that will be available. Such judgements are inherently impacted by estimates affecting future taxable profits such as oil 
and natural gas prices and decommissioning expenditure, see 'Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and 
provisions'.
In July 2023, the UK government enacted legislation to implement the Pillar Two Model rules. The legislation is effective for bp from 1 January 2024 and 
includes an income inclusion rule and a domestic minimum tax, which together are designed to ensure a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in each 
country in which the group operates. Similar legislation is being enacted by other governments around the world. In line with the amendments to IAS 12, 
the exception from recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes has been applied.
In October 2024, the UK government announced changes (effective from 1 November 2024) to the Energy Profits Levy including a 3% increase in the rate 
taking the headline rate of tax on North Sea profits to 78%, an extension to the period of application of the Levy to 31 March 2030 and the removal of the 
Levy’s main investment allowance. The changes to the rate and to the investment allowance were substantively enacted in 2024 and have been applied in 
accounting for current tax and deferred tax in the year, resulting in an additional non-cash deferred tax charge of approximately $0.1 billion. The extension 
of the Levy to 31 March 2030 was substantively enacted after 31 December 2024 and will result in a non-cash deferred tax charge of around $0.5 billion in 
the year ended 31 December 2025.
Significant judgement and estimate: taxation
The value of deferred tax assets and liabilities is an area involving inherent uncertainty and estimation and balances are therefore subject to risk of 
material change as a result of underlying assumptions and judgements used, in particular the forecast of future profitability used to determine the 
recoverability of deferred tax, for example future oil and gas prices, see ‘Significant judgement and estimates - Recoverability of asset carrying values’. It 
is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects of profitability assumptions on the group’s deferred tax assets. It is reasonably possible that 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management’s estimates, material income tax charges or credits, and material changes in current and 
deferred tax assets or liabilities, may arise within the next financial year and in future periods. 
Judgement is required when determining whether a particular tax is an income tax or another type of tax (for example, a production tax). The attributes of 
the tax, including whether it is calculated on profits or another measure such as production or revenues, the extent of deductibility of costs and the 
interaction with existing income taxes, are considered in determining the classification of the tax. Accounting for deferred tax is applied to income taxes 
as described above but is not applied to other types of taxes; rather such taxes are recognized in the income statement in accordance with the applicable 
accounting policy such as Provisions and contingencies. 
This judgement is considered significant only in relation to the group’s taxes payable under the fiscal terms of bp’s onshore concession in Abu Dhabi. 
These are principally reported as income taxes rather than as production taxes.
For more information see Note 9 and Note 33.
Customs duties and sales taxes
Customs duties and sales taxes that are passed on or charged to customers are excluded from revenues and expenses. Assets and liabilities are 
recognized net of the amount of customs duties or sales tax except:
•Customs duties or sales taxes incurred on the purchase of goods and services which are not recoverable from the taxation authority are recognized as 
part of the cost of acquisition of the asset.
•Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of customs duty or sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included within receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
Own equity instruments – treasury shares
The group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are shown as deductions from shareholders’ equity. Treasury shares represent bp shares repurchased 
and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes, shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) to meet the future 
requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the 
consolidated financial statements as treasury shares. The cost of treasury shares subsequently sold or reissued is calculated on a weighted-average 
basis. Consideration, if any, received for the sale of such shares is also recognized in equity. No gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares. Shares repurchased under the share buy-back programme which are immediately cancelled are not 
shown as treasury shares. Instead, the nominal amount is transferred to the capital redemption reserve and any difference to the purchase price is shown 
as a deduction from the profit and loss account reserve in the group statement of changes in equity.Financial statements

Revenue and other income
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when or as the group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised good 
or service to a customer. The transfer of control of oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG, petroleum and chemical products, and other items usually 
coincides with title passing to the customer and the customer taking physical possession. The group principally satisfies its performance obligations at a 
point in time; the amounts of revenue recognized relating to performance obligations satisfied over time are not significant. 
When, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied, the group recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to that 
performance obligation. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the group expects to be entitled. The transaction price is allocated 
to the performance obligations in the contract based on standalone selling prices of the goods or services promised.
Contracts for the sale of commodities are typically priced by reference to quoted prices. Revenue from term commodity contracts is recognized based on 
the contractual pricing provisions for each delivery. Certain of these contracts have pricing terms based on prices at a point in time after delivery has been 
made. Revenue from such contracts is initially recognized based on relevant prices at the time of delivery and subsequently adjusted as appropriate. All 
revenue from these contracts, both that recognized at the time of delivery and that from post-delivery price adjustments, is disclosed as revenue from 
contracts with customers.
Sales and purchase of commodities accounted for under IFRS 15 are presented on a gross basis in Revenue from contracts with customers and 
Purchases respectively. Physically settled derivatives which represent trading or optimization activities are presented net alongside financially settled 
derivative contracts in Other operating revenues within Sales and other operating income. Certain physically settled sale and purchase derivative contracts 
which are not part of trading and optimization activities are presented gross within Other operating revenues and Purchases respectively. Changes in the 
fair value of derivative assets and liabilities prior to physical delivery are also classified as other operating revenues. 
Physical exchanges with counterparties in the same line of business in order to facilitate sales to customers are reported net, as are sales and purchases 
made with a common counterparty, as part of an arrangement similar to a physical exchange. 
Where the group acts as agent on behalf of a third party to procure or market energy commodities, any associated fee income is recognized but no 
purchase or sale is recorded.
Sales and other transactions through which the group loses control of solar projects developed under Lightsource bp’s develop-to-sell business model are 
accounted for as revenues from contracts with customers.
Interest income is recognized as the interest accrues (using the effective interest rate, that is, the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset).
Dividend income from investments is recognized when the shareholders’ right to receive the payment is established.
Contract asset and contract liability balances are included within amounts presented for trade receivables and other payables respectively.
Finance costs
Finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial 
period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their 
intended use. All other finance costs are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Updates to material accounting policy information
Impact of new International Financial Reporting Standards 
Amendments to IAS 7 ' Statement of Cash Flows' and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: disclosures' relating to supplier finance have been adopted for the 
consolidated financial statements for 2024, the additional required disclosures are provided in the Liquidity risk section of Note 29. 
There are no new or other amended standards or interpretations adopted from 1 January 2024 onwards, that have a significant impact on the 
consolidated financial statements for 2024.
Not yet adopted
Amendments to IFRS 9 ' Financial Instruments' relating to the settlement of liabilities through electronic payment systems are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2026 subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. The potential impact on cash and banking operations and 
amounts reported in cash and cash equivalents on adoption of the amendments is currently being assessed. 
IFRS 18 ‘Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements’ will supersede IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027 subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. IFRS 18 (and consequential amendments made to 
IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’, IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies: Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’, IAS 33 ‘Earnings per share’ and IFRS 7  ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’) introduces several new requirements that are expected to impact the presentation and disclosure of the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements. These new requirements include: 
•Requirements to classify all income and expenses included in the statement of profit or loss into one of five categories and to present two new 
mandatory subtotals.
•Requirement to use the operating profit subtotal as the starting point for the indirect method of reporting cash flows from operating activities in the 
statement of cash flows. 
•Specific classification requirements for interest paid/received and dividends received in the statement of cash flows such that interest and dividend 
receipts are included as investing cash flows and interest paid as financing cash flows.
•Required disclosures about certain non-GAAP measures (‘management defined performance measures’) in a single note to the financial statements
•Enhanced guidance on the aggregation of information across all the primary financial statements and the notes.
The group’s evaluation of the effect of adopting IFRS 18 is ongoing but it is currently anticipated that IFRS 18 will have a significant impact on the 
presentation of the Group’s financial statements and related disclosures.

gas & low carbon energy
On 16 September 2024, bp announced that it plans to sell its US onshore wind energy business, bp Wind Energy. bp Wind Energy has interests in ten 
operating onshore wind energy assets across seven US states. As a result of progression of the disposal process during the fourth quarter of 2024, 
completion of a disposal in 2025 is now considered to be highly probable. The carrying amount of assets classified as held for sale at 31 December 2024 
is $569 million, with associated liabilities of $41 million.
On 24 October, bp completed the acquisition of the remaining 50.03% of Lightsource bp. The acquisition included certain assets for which sales processes 
were in progress at the acquisition date. Completion of the sale of these assets within one year of the acquisition date is considered to be highly probable. 
The carrying amount of assets classified as held for sale at 31 December 2024 is $1,702 million, with associated liabilities of $1,050 million.
On 9 December 2024, bp and JERA Co., Inc. agreed to combine their offshore wind businesses to form a new standalone, equally-owned joint venture – 
JERA Nex bp. The parties have agreed to work to complete formation of JERA Nex bp, subject to regulatory and other approvals, by end of the third quarter 
of 2025. bp will contribute its development projects in the UK, Japan, Germany and US into the new joint venture. The related assets and liabilities of those 
projects have, therefore, been classified as held for sale. The carrying amount of assets classified as held for sale at 31 December 2024 is $1,793 million, 
with associated liabilities of $14 million.

3. Business combinations and other significant transactions 
Business combinations  
2024
The group undertook a number of business combinations during 2024. Total consideration was $2,119 million and the amount paid in cash in 2024 
amounted to $978 million offset by cash acquired of $1,031 million.
These business combinations principally relate to the step acquisitions of bp Bunge Bioenergia and Lightsource bp. Total consideration for these two 
acquisitions was $1,328 million and the amount paid in cash in 2024 was $227 million, offset by cash acquired of $589 million. The provisional fair value of 
the net assets (including goodwill) recognized from these business combinations for 2024 was $2,848 million. 
The gain recognized in ‘Interest and other income’ in 2024 as a result of remeasuring the previously held interests in bp Bunge Bioenergia and Lightsource 
bp, to fair value, was $427 million.
Immediately prior to the Lightsource bp business combination, certain assets in the US were transferred from Lightsource bp into a new joint venture 
which remains jointly controlled by bp and certain founder shareholders of Lightsource bp, and is accordingly equity accounted for by bp. The investment 
in the new joint venture was measured at bp's share of the joint venture's net assets and, as a result, income of $498 million has been recognized in 
‘Interest and other income’ in 2024.
Business combinations  
2023
The group undertook a number of business combinations during 2023. Total consideration paid in cash amounted to $1,282 million, offset by cash 
acquired of $484 million. 
The fair value of the net assets (including goodwill) recognized from business combinations in the full year, inclusive  of measurement period adjustments 
for business combinations in previous periods, was $1,228 million. This principally related to the acquisition of TravelCenters of America.

relation to impairments see Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangibles, goodwill and equity-accounted entities within Note 1. See also Note 
12, and Note 15 for further information on impairments by asset category. 
gas & low carbon energy
The 2024 impairment loss of $2,793 million includes amounts in Mauritania & Senegal ($1,495 million), which principally arose as a result of increased 
forecast future expenditure, and a number of other individually immaterial impairments across the segment principally as a result of portfolio

impairment charges or reversals were recognized in 2022 in total, based on their value in use, is $9,609 million.
oil production & operations
Impairment losses and reversals in all years relate primarily to producing assets and, in 2022, equity accounted investments.

166 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

4. Disposals and impairment – continued
other businesses and corporate
The 2022 impairment loss of $13,536 million arises primarily a result of bp's decision to exit its shareholding in Rosneft ($13,479 million, including 
$528 million which relates to estimated earnings in the first two months of the year prior to the loss of significant influence). The recoverable amount of 
the CGU which comprises Rosneft is estimated to be $nil.
5. Segmental analysis 
The group’s organizational structure reflects the various activities in which bp is engaged as well as how performance and resource allocation is evaluated 
by the chief operating decision maker. At 31 December 2024, bp has three reportable segments: Gas & low carbon energy, Oil production & operations, and 
Customers & products. Each are managed separately, with decisions taken for the segment as a whole, and represent a single operating segment that 
does not result from aggregating two or more segments. 
Gas & low carbon energy comprises regions with upstream businesses that predominantly produce natural gas, gas marketing and trading activities and 
the group's solar, wind and hydrogen businesses. 
Oil production & operations comprises regions with upstream activities that predominantly produce crude oil. 
Customers & products comprises the group’s customer-focused businesses, which includes convenience and retail fuels, EV charging, as well as Castrol, 
aviation and B2B and midstream. It also includes our products businesses, refining & oil trading, as well as our bioenergya businesses.
Other businesses and corporate also comprises the group’s shipping and treasury functions, and corporate activities worldwide.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the group’s accounting policies described in Note 1. However, IFRS requires that the 
measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker for the 
purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation. For bp, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit or loss before interest and 
tax which reflects the replacement cost of supplies by excluding from profit or loss before interest and tax inventory holding gains and lossesb. 
Replacement cost profit or loss before interest and tax for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS.
Sales between segments are made at prices that approximate market prices, taking into account the volumes involved. Segment revenues and segment 
results include transactions between business segments. These transactions and any unrealized profits and losses are eliminated on consolidation, unless 
unrealized losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Sales to external customers by region are based on the location of the group 
subsidiary which made the sale. The UK region includes the UK-based international activities of customers & products.
All surpluses and deficits recognized on the group balance sheet in respect of pension and other post-employment benefit plans are allocated to Other 
businesses and corporate. However, the periodic expense relating to these plans is allocated to the operating segments based upon the business in which 
the employees work.
Certain financial information is provided separately for the US as this is an individually material country for bp, and for the UK as this is bp’s country of 
domicile.
a In February 2025 bp announced its intention to move its biogas business to the gas & low carbon energy segment.
b Inventory holding gains and losses represent:
• the difference between the cost of sales calculated using the replacement cost of inventory and the cost of sales calculated on the first-in first-out (FIFO) method after adjusting for any changes in 
provisions where the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than its cost. Under the FIFO method, which we use for IFRS reporting of inventories other than for trading inventories, the cost of 
inventory charged to the income statement is based on its historical cost of purchase or manufacture, rather than its replacement cost. In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting 
effect on reported income. The amounts disclosed as inventory holding gains and losses represent the difference between the charge to the income statement for inventory on a FIFO basis (after 
adjusting for any related movements in net realizable value provisions) and the charge that would have arisen based on the replacement cost of inventory. For this purpose, the replacement cost of 
inventory is calculated using data from each operation’s production and manufacturing system, either on a monthly basis, or separately for each transaction where the system allows this approach.  
• an adjustment relating to certain trading inventories that are not price risk managed which relate to a minimum inventory volume that is required to be held to maintain underlying business activities. This 
adjustment represents the movement in fair value of the inventories due to prices, on a grade-by-grade basis, during the period. This is calculated from each operation’s inventory management system on 
a monthly basis using the discrete monthly movement in market prices for these inventories.
The amounts disclosed are not separately reflected in the financial statements as a gain or loss. No adjustment is made in respect of the cost of inventories held as part of a 
trading position and certain other temporary inventory positions that are price risk-managed.Financial statements

respect of the impact of the UK Energy Profits Levy on existing temporary differences unwinding over the period 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2028.
c The adjustment in respect of prior years reflects the reassessment of the deferred tax balances for prior periods in light of changes in facts and circumstances during the year, including changes to price 
assumptions and profit forecasts. 2024 also includes a charge of $213 million (2023 $232 million credit) in respect of a revision to the deferred tax impact of the UK Energy Profits Levy.
In 2024, the total tax credit recognized within other comprehensive income was $782 million (2023 $735 million credit and 2022 $266 million charge). In 
2024 this primarily comprises a $658 million credit in respect of the reduction in the deferred tax liability on defined benefit pension plan surpluses 
following the reduction in the rate of the authorized surplus payments tax charge in the UK from 35% to 25%. In 2023 this primarily comprises the deferred 
tax impact of the remeasurements of the net pension and other post-employment benefit liability or asset. In 2022 this primarily comprises a release of 
deferred withholding tax on other comprehensive income movements relating to Rosneft. See Note 32 for further information.
The total tax charge recognized directly in equity was $167 million (2023 $56 million charge and 2022 $214 million credit). In 2024 this mainly relates to 
share-based payments and transactions involving non-controlling interests. In 2023 and 2022 this mainly relates to transactions involving non-controlling

b The 2022 income statement includes amounts relating to deferred withholding tax on unremitted earnings of Rosneft. The 2024 and 2023 balance sheet amounts do not include any temporary differences 
that are individually significant.
c The 2024 and 2023 balance sheet amounts include amounts relating to share based payments and other items.
Of the $5,403 million of deferred tax assets recognized on the group balance sheet at 31 December 2024 (2023 $4,268 million), $3,232 million (2023 
$2,336 million) relates to entities that have suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period. For 2024, this mainly includes $1,680 million in 
Germany, $744 million in Mauritania and $609 million in Senegal (2023 mainly included $1,003 million in Germany, $672 million in Mauritania and $500 
million in Senegal). For 2024 these amounts are supported by forecasts consistent with bp's future oil and gas price assumptions (see Note 1 for further 
information) and for Germany, forecast profits associated with the customers & products businesses, that indicate sufficient future taxable profits will be 
available to utilize such assets within any applicable expiry period.

c The UK unused tax credits arise predominantly in overseas branches of UK entities based in jurisdictions with higher statutory corporate income tax rates than the UK. No deferred tax asset has been 
recognized on these tax credits as they are unlikely to have value in the future; UK taxes on these overseas branches are largely mitigated by double tax relief in respect of overseas tax. These tax credits 
have no fixed expiry date.
d The US unused tax credits predominantly comprise foreign tax credits. No deferred tax asset has been recognized on these tax credits as they are unlikely to have value in the future. For 2024 these tax 
credits expire in the period 2025-2034.
e 2024 and 2023 mainly comprise fixed asset temporary differences in overseas branches of UK entities. Substantially all of the temporary differences have no expiry date.

The board decided not to offer a scrip dividend alternative in respect of any dividends announced since the third quarter 2019, including the fourth quarter 
2024 dividend expected to be paid on 28 March 2025.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 do not reflect the dividend announced on 11 February 2025 and which is expected to be 
paid on 28 March 2025; this will be treated as an appropriation of profit in the year ending 31 December 2025.

Diluted earnings per share  0.14  5.15  (0.79) 
a One ADS is equivalent to six ordinary shares.
Basic earnings per ordinary share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to bp ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
The weighted average number of shares outstanding includes certain shares that will be issuable in the future under employee share-based payment plans 
and excludes treasury shares, which includes shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan trusts (ESOPs).
For the diluted earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the average number of 
shares that are potentially issuable in connection with employee share-based payment plans. If the inclusion of potentially issuable shares would decrease 
loss per share, the potentially issuable shares are excluded from the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings 
per share.

11. Earnings per share – continued
The number of ordinary shares outstanding at 31 December 2024, excluding treasury shares, and including certain shares that will be issuable in the future 
under employee share-based payment plans was 15,851,028,983 (2023 16,824,651,796). Between 31 December 2024 and 14 February 2025, the latest 
practicable date before the completion of these financial statements, there was a net decrease of 118,209,740 of ordinary shares primarily as a result of 
share buy backs. For additional information on share buy backs see Note 31.
Employee share-based payment plans
The group operates share and share option plans for directors and certain employees to obtain ordinary shares and ADSs in the company. Information on 
these plans for directors is shown in the Directors remuneration report on pages 88-110.
The following table shows the number of shares potentially issuable under equity-settled employee share option plans, including the number of options 
outstanding, the number of options exercisable at the end of each year, and the corresponding weighted average exercise prices. The dilutive effect of 
these plans at 31 December is also shown.

b At 31 December 2024 the quoted market price of one bp ordinary share was £3.93 (2023 £4.66).
In addition, the group operates a number of equity-settled employee share plans under which share units are granted to the group’s senior leaders and 
certain other employees. These plans typically have a three-year performance or restricted period during which the units accrue net notional dividends 
which are treated as having been reinvested. Leaving employment will normally preclude the conversion of units into shares, but special arrangements 
apply for participants that leave for qualifying reasons. The number of shares that are expected to vest each year under employee share plans are shown in 
the table below. The dilutive effect of the employee share plans at 31 December is also shown.

Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to groups of cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the acquisition. For oil production & operations goodwill is allocated to CGUs in aggregate at the segment level, for gas & low carbon energy, 
goodwill is allocated to the hydrocarbon CGUs ('gas businesses') within the segment and to Lightsource bp (LSbp). For customers and products, goodwill 
has been allocated to Castrol, US Fuels, European Fuels, Archaea and Other.

The table above shows the carrying amount of goodwill for the segments at the period end and the excess of the recoverable amount over the carrying 
amount (headroom) at the date of the most recent test. The recoverable amount for the gas businesses and the oil production & operations segment is  
based on a pre-tax value-in-use calculation. The decrease in headroom for both of these goodwill impairment tests is due to changes in a number of 
assumptions including prices and production as well as, for the oil productions & operations segment, certain tax assumptions and, for the gas 
businesses, divestments. The recoverable amount for the LSbp goodwill is based on fair value less costs of disposal. 
No material impairment of the goodwill balances in either gas & low carbon energy or oil production & operations was recognized during 2024 or 2023.

14. Goodwill and impairment review of goodwill – continued
Gas businesses and oil production & operations
The value in use for relevant CGUs in both the gas businesses and oil production & operations is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by the 
projected production profiles up to the expected dates of cessation of production of each field, based on appropriately risked estimates of reserves and 
resources. Midstream and supply and trading activities and equity-accounted entities are generally not included in the impairment reviews of goodwill, as 
they do not represent part of the grouping of CGUs to which the goodwill balances relate and which are used to monitor the goodwill balances for internal 
management purposes. Where such activities form part of wider CGUs to which goodwill relates they are reflected in the test. As the production profile and 
related cash flows can be estimated from bp’s past experience, management believes that the cash flows generated over the estimated life of field is the 
appropriate basis upon which to assess goodwill and individual assets for impairment in both the gas businesses and oil & production operations. The 
estimated date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the 
production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, production costs, the 
contractual duration of the production concession and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced. As each field has specific reservoir characteristics 
and economic circumstances, the cash flows of each field are computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions agreed by 
bp management. 
Estimated production volumes and cash flows up to the date of cessation of production on a field-by-field basis, including operating and capital 
expenditure, are derived from the business segment plans. The production profiles used are consistent with the reserve and resource volumes approved as 
part of bp’s centrally controlled process for the estimation of proved and probable reserves and total resources.
The average production for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing in the gas businesses over the next 15 years is 154 mmboe per year (2023 185 
mmboe per year) and in the oil production and operations segment is 400 mmboe per year (2023 402 mmboe per year). Production assumptions used for 
the goodwill impairment tests in both the gas businesses and oil production & operations reflect management’s best estimate of future production of the 
existing portfolio at the time of the calculation.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate used in the review for the oil production & operations segment is 17%, and 11% for the gas businesses (2023 
17% for the oil production & operations segment and 11% for the gas businesses).
The most recent reviews for impairment for the oil production & operations and the gas businesses were carried out in the fourth quarter. The key 
assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and the discount rate. The value-in-use calculations 
have been prepared for the purposes of determining whether the goodwill balances were impaired. Estimated future cash flows were prepared on the 
basis of certain assumptions prevailing at the time of the tests. The actual outcomes may differ from the assumptions made. For example, reserves and 
resources estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change. 
Due to economic developments, regulatory change and emissions reduction activity arising from climate concern and other factors, future commodity 
prices and other assumptions may differ from the forecasts used in the calculations.
Sensitivities to different variables have been estimated using certain simplifying assumptions. For example, lower oil and gas price or production 
sensitivities do not fully reflect the specific impacts for each contractual arrangement and will not capture all favourable impacts that may arise from cost 
deflation or savings. A detailed calculation at any given price or production profile may, therefore, produce a different result.
It is estimated that a 11% (2023 22%) reduction in revenue throughout each year of the remaining life of those assets, either as a result of adverse price or 
production conditions or a combination of each, would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-
current assets of the oil production and operations segment. For the gas businesses a 6% (2023 15%) reduction would have the same result.
It is estimated that no reasonably possible change in the discount rate of the oil production and operations segment would cause the recoverable amount 
to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets. For the gas businesses a 2% increase would have this result (2023 no 
reasonably possible change).  
Lightsource bp
The Lightsource bp goodwill largely relates to the value attributed to the business’s project development capability, including the workforce in place. 
Management considers the fair value of Lightsource bp at 31 December 2024 to be substantially the same as at the date of acquisition in the fourth 
quarter of 2024.

Cash flows for each group of CGUs are derived from the business segment plans, which cover a period of up to five years, except for Archaea where a 
business plan to 2035 is in place following the acquisition in 2022. To determine the value in use for each of the groups of cash-generating units, cash 
flows for a period of 10 years (11 years for Archaea), are discounted and aggregated with a terminal value. Pre-tax discount rates ranging from 10-12% are 
applied. It is estimated that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used in the US Fuels, European Fuels and Archaea goodwill impairment 
assessments would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets.
No material impairment of the goodwill balances in customers & products was recognized during 2024 or 2023. 
Castrol
The key assumptions to which the calculation of value in use for the Castrol unit is most sensitive are operating unit margins, sales volumes, and discount 
rate. Operating margin and sales volumes assumptions used in the detailed impairment review of goodwill calculation are consistent with the assumptions 
used in the Castrol unit’s business plan. A pre-tax discount rate of 9% (2023 9%) is applied in the test. No reasonably possible change in any of these key 
assumptions would cause the unit’s recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets. Cash flows 
beyond the plan period are extrapolated using a nominal 3.4% (2023 3.4%) growth rate.Financial statements

In the normal course of business, bp enters into various arm’s length transactions with joint ventures including fixed price commitments to sell and to 
purchase commodities, forward sale and purchase contracts and agency agreements.
The terms of the outstanding balances receivable from joint ventures are typically 30 to 45 days. The balances are unsecured and will be settled in cash. 
There are no significant provisions for doubtful debts relating to these balances and no significant expense recognized in the income statement in respect 
of bad or doubtful debts. Dividends receivable are not included in the table above.
The majority of sales to joint ventures in 2024 relate to heating oil, gasoline, diesel and lubricant product transactions with Mobene and Ocwen Energy. The 
majority of purchases from joint ventures in 2024 relate to crude oil and oil products transactions with Azule Energy.
bp's share of net impairment charges recognized by joint ventures in 2024 was $477 million (2023 $1,285 million and 2022 $256 million) of which $nil 
charge (2023 $1,152 million and 2022 $276 million) was in the gas and low carbon energy segment and $477 million charge (2023 $133 million charge 
and 2022 reversals of $20 million) was in the oil production & operations segment. The 2023 charges in the gas and low carbon energy segment principally 
relate to the group's US offshore wind investments. 
17. Investments in associates
The following table provides aggregated summarized financial information for the group’s associates as it relates to the amounts recognized in the group 
income statement and on the group balance sheet. There were no individually material associates to the Group at 31 December 2024. On 27 February 
2022, bp announced it would exit its shareholding in Rosneft and bp's two nominated Rosneft directors both stepped down from Rosneft's board. As a 
result, the significant judgement on significant influence over Rosneft was reassessed. Since the first quarter 2022, bp accounts for its interest in Rosneft 
and its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia, as financial assets measured at fair value within ‘Other investments’. For further information see Note

24. Pensions and other post-employment benefits 
Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Pension 
benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans (money purchase schemes) or defined benefit plans (final salary and other types of schemes 
with committed pension benefit payments). For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from 
contributions paid in respect of each employee. For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as an employee’s pensionable 
salary and length of service. Defined benefit plans may be funded or unfunded. The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered 
trusts.
For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to accounting for these plans see Pensions and other post-employment benefits 
in Note 1.
The defined benefit pension obligation in the UK consists primarily of a closed funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the 
majority of their benefit as an annuity. This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated 
directors, four company-nominated directors, one independent director and one independent chair nominated by the company. The trustee board is 
required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan.
Employees in the UK are eligible for membership of defined contribution plans established with third-party providers.
In the US, all pension benefits now accrue under a cash balance formula. Benefits previously accrued under final salary formulas are legally protected. 
Retiring US employees typically take their pension benefit in the form of a lump sum payment upon retirement. The plan is funded and its assets are 
overseen by a fiduciary Investment Committee. At the end of 2024 the committee was composed of five bp employees appointed by the president of bp 
Corporation North America Inc. (the appointing officer). The Investment Committee is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants 
and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as the investment policies of the plan. US employees are also eligible to participate in a defined 
contribution (401k) plan in which employee contributions are matched with company contributions.
In the US, group companies also provide post-employment healthcare to eligible retired employees and their dependants (and, in certain legacy cases, life 
insurance coverage); the entitlement to these benefits is based on the date of hire, the employee remaining in service until a specified age and completion 
of a minimum period of service.
In the Eurozone, there are defined benefit pension plans in Germany, France, the Netherlands and other countries. In Germany and France, the majority of 
the pensions are unfunded. In Germany, the group’s largest Eurozone plan, employees receive a pension and also have a choice to supplement their core 
pension through salary sacrifice. For employees who joined since 2002, the core pension benefit is a career average plan with retirement benefits based on 
such factors as an employee’s pensionable salary and length of service. The returns on the notional contributions made by both the company and 
employees are based on the interest rate which is set out in German tax law. Retired German employees take their pension benefit typically in the form of 
an annuity. The German plans are governed by legal agreements between bp and the works council or between bp and the trade union.
The level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due. 
During 2024 the aggregate level of contributions was $69 million (2023 $42 million and 2022 $74 million). The aggregate level of contributions in 2025 is 
expected to be approximately $150 million and includes contributions in all countries that we expect to be required to make contributions by law or under 
contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.
For the primary UK defined benefit plan there is a funding agreement between the group and the trustee. On a three year cycle a schedule of contributions 
is agreed covering the next five years. The schedule of contributions is next scheduled to be updated after the 31 December 2026 formal actuarial 
valuation. No contractually committed funding was due at 31 December 2024. 
The surplus relating to the primary UK defined benefit pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund 
of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan. 
Minimum pension funding in the US is determined by legislation and is supplemented by discretionary contributions. No contributions were made into the 
US pension plan in 2024 and no statutory funding requirement is expected in the next 12 months.
The surplus relating to the US pension fund is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that economic benefit can be gained from the surplus through 
a reduction in future contributions.
There was no minimum funding requirement for the US plan, and no significant minimum funding requirements in other countries at 31 December 2024.
The obligation and cost of providing pensions and other post-employment benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method. The date 
of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2024. The UK defined benefit plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years; 
valuations are required more frequently in many other countries. The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the primary UK defined benefit pension plan 
was as at 31 December 2023. A valuation of the US plan and largest Eurozone plans are carried out annually.Financial statements

a UK discount rate and inflation rate assumptions are not relevant in determining the benefit expense for the closed UK plan. Rates for the remaining small worldwide plan administered/reported through the 
UK are 5.0% (2023 5.0% and 2022 2.5%) and 1.9% (2023 1.9% and 2022 2.2%) respectively.
The discount rate assumptions are based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and for our largest plans in the UK, US and the Eurozone we use yields 
that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments. The inflation rate assumptions for our UK and US plans are based on the difference 
between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds. In other countries, including the Eurozone, we use this approach, or 
advice from the local actuary depending on the information available. The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in 
payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase. 
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions. The mortality assumptions reflect best practice 
in the countries in which we provide pensions and have been chosen with regard to applicable published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the 
experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future. bp’s most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US 
and the Eurozone where our mortality assumptions are as follows:

Pension plan assets are generally held in trusts, the primary objective of which is to accumulate assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plans. The 
assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.
A proportion of the assets are held in equities, which are expected to generate a higher level of return over the long term, with an acceptable level of risk. In 
order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios 
are highly diversified.
The trustee’s long-term investment objective for the primary UK defined benefit plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same 
way as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk. To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment (LDI) 
approach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability 
assumptions of interest rate and inflation rate. This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money 
using existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date. The funds raised are used to invest in further 
bonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities. The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in 
the table below.
For the primary UK defined benefit plan there is an agreement with the trustee to at least maintain the proportion of assets with liability matching 
characteristics and review over time. There is a similar agreement in place for the primary US plan. During 2024, the asset allocation policies of  the 
primary UK and US plans remained unchanged. 
The current asset allocation policy for the major plans at 31 December 2024 was as follows:

The amounts invested under the LDI programme by the primary UK pension plan as at 31 December 2024 were $4,970 million (2023 $6,215 million) of 
government-issued nominal bonds and $11,105 million (2023 $13,177 million) of index-linked bonds.
Some of the group’s pension plans in the Eurozone and other countries use derivative financial instruments as part of their asset mix to manage the level 
of risk. The fair value of these instruments is included in other assets in the table below. 
The group’s main pension plans do not invest directly in either securities or property/real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.
The fair values of the various categories of assets held by the defined benefit plans at 31 December are presented in the table below, including the effects 
of derivative financial instruments. Movements in the fair value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail in the table on page 190.

a The costs of managing plan investments are offset against the investment return, the costs of administering pension plan benefits are generally included in current service cost and the costs of 
administering other post-employment benefit plans are included in the benefit obligation. Following the closure of the primary UK pension plan, current service cost in the UK consists of $30 million of 
costs of administering that plan and $11 million of current service cost from the remaining small worldwide plans administered and reported through the UK.
b Past service costs predominantly represent largely offsetting income and costs due to the removal of some benefits for members in Turkish plans and their replacement with new arrangements 
administered and reported through the UK. Settlements reflect costs associated with buyouts in Canada and in certain other small worldwide plans administered and reported through the UK.
Sensitivity analysis
The discount rate, inflation and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the amounts reported. A one-percentage point change, in 
isolation, in certain assumptions as at 31 December 2024 for the group’s pensions and other post-employment benefit expense would have had the effects 
shown in the tables below. The effects shown for the expense in 2025 comprise the total of current service cost and net finance income or expense.

Long-term borrowings in the table below include the portion of debt that matures in the 12 months from 31 December 2024, whereas in the group balance 
sheet the amount is reported within current finance debt.
The carrying amount of the group’s short-term borrowings, comprising mainly of commercial paper, approximates their fair value. The fair values of the 
significant majority of the group’s long-term borrowings are determined using quoted prices in active markets, and so fall within level 1 of the fair value 
hierarchy. Where quoted prices are not available, quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets are used and such measurements are therefore 
categorized in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

27. Capital disclosures and net debt 
The group defines capital as total equity plus net debt. Our financial framework seeks to support the pursuit of value growth for shareholders while 
maintaining a secure financial base.
The group monitors capital on the basis of gearing, that is, the ratio of net debt to the total of net debt plus total equity. Net debt is calculated as finance 
debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign exchange and interest 
rate risks relating to finance debt for which hedge accounting is applied, less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt and gearing are non-IFRS measures. bp 
believes these measures provide useful information to investors. Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of finance debt, related hedges and 
cash and cash equivalents in total. Gearing enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to total equity. The derivatives are reported on the 
balance sheet within the headings ‘Derivative financial instruments’. All components of equity are included in the denominator of the calculation.
At 31 December 2024, gearing was 22.7% (2023 19.7%).

28. Leases 
The group leases a number of assets as part of its activities. This primarily includes drilling rigs in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon 
energy segments and retail service stations, oil depots and storage tanks in the customer & products segment as well as office accommodation and 
vessel charters across the group. The weighted-average remaining lease term for the total lease portfolio is around 8 years (2023 7 years). Some leases 
have payments that vary with market interest or inflation rates. Certain leases contain residual value guarantees, which may be triggered in certain 
circumstances such as if market values have significantly declined at the conclusion of the lease.

Financial risk factors
The group is exposed to a number of different financial risks arising from ordinary business exposures as well as its use of financial instruments including 
market risks relating to commodity prices; foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; credit risk; and liquidity risk.
The group financial risk committee (GFRC) advises the chief financial officer (CFO) who oversees the management of these risks. The GFRC is chaired by 
the CFO and consists of a group of senior managers including the EVP supply, trading and shipping and SVPs treasury, tax, accounting reporting control 
and planning & performance management. The purpose of the committee is to advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance 
framework for the group. The committee provides assurance to the CFO and the chief executive officer (CEO), and via the CEO to the board, that the 
group’s financial risk-taking activity is governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in 
accordance with group policies and group risk appetite.
The group’s trading activities in the oil, natural gas, LNG and power markets are managed within the supply, trading and shipping business. Treasury holds 
foreign exchange and interest-rate products in the financial markets to hedge group exposures related to debt and hybrid bond issuance; the compliance, 
control and risk management processes for these activities are managed within the treasury business. All other foreign exchange and interest rate 
activities within financial markets are performed within the supply, trading and shipping business and are also underpinned by the compliance, control and 
risk management infrastructure common to the activities of bp’s supply, trading and shipping business. All derivative activity is carried out by specialist 
teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. These teams are subject to close financial and management control.
The supply, trading and shipping business maintains formal governance processes that provide oversight of market risk, credit risk and operational risk 
associated with trading activity. A policy and risk committee approves value-at-risk delegations, reviews incidents and validates risk-related policies, 
methodologies and procedures. A commitments committee approves the trading of new products, instruments and strategies and material commitments.
In addition, the supply, trading and shipping business undertakes derivative activity for risk management purposes under a control framework as described 
more fully below. 
(a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market price movements and their impact on the future performance of a business. The primary 
commodity price risks that the group is exposed to include oil, natural gas and power prices that could adversely affect the value of the group’s financial 
assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The group has developed a control framework aimed at managing the volatility inherent in certain of its 
ordinary business exposures. In accordance with the control framework the group enters into various transactions using derivatives for risk management 
purposes.
The major components of market risk are commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk, each of which is discussed below.
(i) Commodity price risk
The group’s supply, trading and shipping business is responsible for delivering value across the overall crude, oil products, gas, LNG and power supply 
chains. As such, it routinely enters into spot and term physical commodity contracts in addition to optimising physical storage, pipeline and transportation 
capacity. These activities expose the group to commodity price risk which is managed by entering into oil, natural gas and power swaps, options and 
futures.
The group measures market risk exposure arising from its risk managed trading positions using value-at-risk techniques based on Monte Carlo simulation 
models. These techniques make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market prices over a one-day holding 
period within a 95% confidence level. Risk managed trading activity is subject to value-at-risk and other limits for each trading activity and the aggregate of 
196 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

29. Financial instruments and financial risk factors – continued 
all trading activity. The calculation of potential changes in value within the risk managed period considers positions, historical price movements and the 
correlation of these price movements. Models are regularly reviewed against actual fair value movements to ensure integrity is maintained. The value-at-
risk measure is supplemented by stress testing and scenario analysis through simulating the financial impact of certain physical, economic and geo-
political scenarios. The value-at-risk measure in respect of the aggregated risk managed trading positions at 31 December 2024 was $42 million (2023 $26 
million) whereas the average value-at-risk measure for the period was $35 million (2023 $49 million). This measure incorporates the effect of 
diversification reflecting the offsetting risks across the trading portfolio. Alternative measures are used to monitor exposures which are not risk managed 
and for which value-at-risk techniques are not appropriate. 
(ii) Foreign currency exchange risk
Since bp has global operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the group’s reported results and future 
expenditure commitments. The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results through changing cost 
competitiveness, lags in market adjustment to movements in rates and translation differences accounted for on specific transactions. For this reason, the 
total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the group’s reported results. The main underlying economic currency of the 
group’s cash flows is the US dollar. This is because bp’s major product, oil, is priced internationally in US dollars. bp’s foreign currency exchange 
management policy is to limit economic and material transactional exposures arising from currency movements against the US dollar. The group co-
ordinates the handling of foreign currency exchange risks centrally, by netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures wherever possible and then 
managing any material residual foreign currency exchange risks.
Most of the group’s borrowings are in US dollars or are hedged with respect to the US dollar. At 31 December 2024, the total foreign currency borrowings 
not swapped into US dollars amounted to $555 million (2023 $309 million). The group also has in issue perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds in euro, 
sterling and US dollars. Whilst the contractual terms of these instruments allow the group to defer coupon payments and the repayment of principal 
indefinitely, the group has chosen to manage the foreign currency exposure relating to the non-US dollar hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods.
The group manages the net residual foreign currency exposures by constantly reviewing the foreign currency economic value at risk and aims to manage 
such risk to keep the 12-month foreign currency value at risk below $400 million. At no point over the past three years did the value at risk exceed the 
maximum risk limit. A continuous assessment is made in respect of the group’s foreign currency exposures to capture hedging requirements. 
During the year, hedge accounting was applied to foreign currency exposure to highly probable forecast capital expenditure commitments. The group fixes 
the US dollar cost of non-US dollar supplies by using currency forwards for the highly probable forecast capital expenditure. At 31 December 2024 the 
most significant open contracts in place were for USD equivalent amounts of $92 million sterling (2023 $296 million sterling).
Where the group enters into foreign currency exchange contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using trading value-at-risk 
techniques as explained in (i) commodity price risk above. 
(iii) Interest rate risk
bp is also exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial 
instruments, principally finance debt. While the group issues debt and hybrid bonds in a variety of currencies based on market opportunities, it uses 
derivatives to swap the economic exposure to a floating rate basis, mainly to US dollar floating, but in certain defined circumstances maintains a US dollar 
fixed rate exposure for a proportion of debt. The proportion of floating rate debt net of interest rate swaps at 31 December 2024 was 30% of total finance 
debt outstanding (2023 35%). The weighted average interest rate on finance debt at 31 December 2024 was 5% (2023 5%) and the weighted average 
maturity of fixed rate debt was eight years (2023 thirteen years).
The group’s earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the element of the group’s finance debt that is contractually floating rate or has been 
swapped to floating rates. If the interest rates applicable to these floating rate instruments of $18,006 million (2023 $18,238 million) (see Note 26) were to 
have changed by one percentage point on 1 January 2025, it is estimated that the group’s finance costs for 2025 would change by approximately $180 
million (2023 $182 million). 
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due causing financial loss to the 
group and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with financial institutions and principally from credit 
exposures to customers relating to outstanding receivables. Credit exposure also exists in relation to guarantees issued by group companies under which 
the outstanding exposure incremental to that recognized on the balance sheet at 31 December 2024 was $655 million (2023 $1,655 million) in respect of 
liabilities of joint ventures and associates and $585 million (2023 $598 million) in respect of liabilities of other third parties. An amount of $146 million 
(2023 $201 million) is recorded as a liability at 31 December 2024 in relation to these guarantees. For all guarantees, maturity dates vary, and the 
guarantees will terminate on payment and/or cancellation of the obligation. In general, a payment under the guarantee contract would be triggered by 
failure of the guaranteed party to fulfil its obligation covered by the guarantee.Financial statements

29. Financial instruments and financial risk factors – continued
The group has a credit policy, approved by the CFO, that is designed to ensure that consistent processes are in place throughout the group to measure and 
control credit risk. Credit risk is considered as part of the risk-reward balance of doing business. On entering into any business contract the extent to which 
the arrangement exposes the group to credit risk is considered. Key requirements of the policy include segregation of credit approval authorities from any 
sales, marketing or trading teams authorized to incur credit risk; the establishment of credit systems and processes to ensure that all counterparty 
exposure is rated and that all counterparty exposure and limits can be monitored and reported; and the timely identification and reporting of any non-
approved credit exposures and credit losses. While each segment is responsible for its own credit risk management and reporting consistent with group 
policy, treasury holds group-wide credit risk authority and oversight responsibility for exposure to banks and financial institutions. 
For the purposes of financial reporting the group calculates expected loss allowances based on the maximum contractual period over which the group is 
exposed to credit risk. Lifetime expected credit losses are recognized for trade receivables and the credit risk associated with the significant majority of 
financial assets measured at amortized cost is considered to be low. Since the tenor of substantially all of the group's in-scope financial assets is less than 
12 months there is no significant difference between the measurement of 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses. Expected loss allowances for 
financial guarantee contracts are typically lower than their initial fair value less, where appropriate, amortization. Financial assets are considered to be 
credit-impaired when there is reasonable and supportable evidence that one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash 
flows of the financial asset have occurred. This includes observable data concerning significant financial difficulty of the counterparty; a breach of 
contract; concession being granted to the counterparty for economic or contractual reasons relating to the counterparty’s financial difficulty, that would 
not otherwise be considered; it becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial re-organization or an active market for the 
financial asset disappearing because of financial difficulties. The group also applies a rebuttable presumption that an asset is credit-impaired when 
contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Where the group has no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a 
portion thereof, for example where all legal avenues for collection of amounts due have been exhausted, the financial asset (or relevant portion) is written 
off.
The measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss after recovery if 
there is a default) and the exposure at default (i.e. the asset's carrying amount). The group allocates a credit risk rating to exposures based on data that is 
determined to be predictive of the risk of loss, including but not limited to external ratings. Probabilities of default derived from historical, current and 
future-looking market data are assigned by credit risk rating with a loss given default based on historical experience and relevant market and academic 
research applied by exposure type. Experienced credit judgement is applied to ensure probabilities of default are reflective of the credit risk associated with 
the group's exposures. Credit enhancements that would reduce the group's credit losses in the event of default are reflected in the calculation when they 
are considered integral to the related asset.
The maximum credit exposure associated with financial assets is equal to the carrying amount. The group does not aim to remove credit risk entirely but 
expects to experience a certain level of credit losses. As at 31 December 2024, the group had in place credit enhancements designed to mitigate 
approximately $9.2 billion (2023 $12.0 billion) of credit risk of which approximately $8.2 billion (2023 $10.7 billion) related to assets in the scope of IFRS 9's 
impairment requirements. Credit enhancements include standby and documentary letters of credit, bank guarantees, insurance and liens which are 
typically taken out with financial institutions who have investment grade credit ratings, or are liens over assets held by the counterparty of the related 
receivables. Reports are regularly prepared and presented to the GFRC that cover the group’s overall credit exposure and expected loss trends, exposure 
by segment, and overall quality of the portfolio.
Management information used to monitor credit risk, which reflects the impact of credit enhancements, indicates that the risk profile of financial assets 
which are subject to review for impairment under IFRS 9 is as set out in the table below.

(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for the group’s business activities may not be available. The group’s liquidity is managed centrally 
with operating units forecasting their cash and currency requirements to the central treasury function. Unless restricted by local regulations, generally 
subsidiaries pool their cash surpluses to the treasury function, which will then arrange to fund other subsidiaries’ requirements, or invest any net surplus in 
the market or arrange for necessary external borrowings, while managing the group’s overall net currency positions. While there is the potential for 
concerns about the energy transition to impact banks’ or debt investors’ appetite to finance hydrocarbon activity, we do not anticipate any material change 
to the group's funding or liquidity in the short to medium term as a result of such concerns.
The group benefits from open credit provided by suppliers who generally sell on five to 60-day payment terms in accordance with industry norms. bp 
utilizes various arrangements in order to manage its working capital and reduce volatility in cash flow. This includes discounting of receivables and, in the 
supply and trading businesses, managing inventory, collateral and supplier payment terms within a maximum of 60 days.
It is normal practice in the oil and gas supply and trading business for customers and suppliers to utilize letters of credit (LCs) facilities to mitigate credit 
and non-performance risk. Consequently, LCs facilitate active trading in a global market where credit and performance risk can be significant. In common 
with the industry, bp routinely provides LCs to some of its suppliers. 
The group has committed LC facilities totalling $12,130 million (2023 $13,180 million), allowing LCs to be issued for a maximum 24-month duration. The 
facilities are held with 16 international banks.
In certain circumstances, the supplier has the option to request accelerated payment from the LC provider in order to further reduce their exposure. bp’s 
payments are made to the provider of the LC rather than the supplier according to the original contractual payment terms. At 31 December 2024, a portion 
of the group’s trade payables which were subject to the LC arrangements were payable to LC providers, with no material exposure to any individual 
provider. If these facilities were not available, this could result in renegotiation of payment terms with suppliers such that payment terms were shorter.
The group sometimes uses promissory notes to pay its suppliers and other counterparties. This is primarily done to facilitate the counterparty accelerating 
its cash inflow without also accelerating the group’s related cash outflow. For instance, if a supplier to the group’s supply, trading and shipping business 
would like prepayment or early-payment for a supply of goods, the group may issue a promissory note (payable at a future date) in favour of that supplier 
on the supplier’s desired cash inflow date, which that supplier can then convert to cash by selling it to a finance provider on the same-day. The majority of 
promissory notes the group issues accrue interest on the principal amount of the note at a fixed rate stated on the note from issuance to maturity. This is 
done to give the supplier or other counterparty certainty about the amount they will receive when they sell the note. It also gives the group flexibility to 
select the maturity date of the note without that impacting the net present value of the note on its issuance date. The maturity date the group selects for 
any promissory note that is for the purchase of goods by its supply and trading business will be no more than 60 days after the group takes (or expects to 
take) title to those goods.
A portion of the group's trade payables form part of a reverse factoring arrangement with select suppliers.
Suppliers’ participation in the reverse factoring arrangement is voluntary. Suppliers that participate have the option to receive early payment on invoices 
from the group’s external finance provider. If suppliers choose to receive early payment, they pay a fee to the finance provider. If they opt not to receive 
early payment, they will pay no fee to the finance provider and will be paid the full invoice amount on the invoice due date. The group provides data about 
invoices subject to the arrangement directly to the finance provider. This data includes the invoice due date and the maturity date for each invoice.  The 
invoice due date is the date the supplier would have been entitled to receive payment from the group had the invoice not been made subject to the reverse 
factoring arrangement. The maturity date, which is the date the group will settle that invoice by paying the finance provider, will, in some cases, be the 
same as the invoice due date. In other cases, it will be a date selected by the group that is no more than 60 days after the group has taken title to the goods 
to which the invoice relates. If the group selects a maturity date that is after the invoice due date, the group pays the finance provider a fee.  
Management does not consider the reverse factoring arrangement to result in excessive concentrations of liquidity risk, in part because the finance 
provider has the option to (and does) sub-participate portions of the financings to other finance providers. The arrangements have been established for a 
variety of reasons, including to ease the administrative burden of managing high volumes of invoices from some suppliers, to facilitate some suppliers 
having the option to accelerate when they receive payment or, often at a lower cost than that supplier’s usual cost of borrowing, and, in some cases, to 
manage the working capital and reduce volatility in cash flow of the group’s supply and trading business. The group has not derecognised the original 
trade payables relating to the arrangements because the original liability is not substantially modified on entering into the arrangements.Financial statements

b The group applied transitional relief available under IAS 7 and has not provided comparative information in the first year of adoption.               
The group does not provide any collateral to the external finance provider.
There were no material business combinations or foreign exchange differences that would affect the liabilities under the supplier finance arrangement in 
either period. 
There were no significant non-cash changes in the carrying amount of financial liabilities subject to the supplier finance arrangements. The payments to 
the bank are included within operating cash flows because they continue to be part of the normal operating cycle of the group and their principal nature 
remains operating – i.e., payment for the purchase of goods and services.
If these facilities were not available, this could result in renegotiation of payment terms with suppliers such that settlement periods were shorter. 
Standard & Poor’s Ratings long-term credit rating for bp is A- (stable) and Moody’s Investors Service rating is A1 (stable) and the Fitch Ratings' long-term 
credit rating is A+ (stable).
During 2024, $9 billion (2023 $6 billion) of long-term taxable bonds were issued with terms ranging from three to twelve years. In addition the group issued 
perpetual hybrid capital bonds and securities with a US dollar equivalent value of $4.3 billion (2023 $0.2 billion). Commercial paper is issued at competitive 
rates to meet short-term borrowing requirements as and when needed.
As a further liquidity measure, the group continues to maintain suitable levels of cash and cash equivalents, amounting to $39.2 billion at 31 December 
2024 (2023 $33.0 billion), primarily invested with highly rated banks or money market funds and readily accessible at immediate and short notice. As at  31 
December 2024, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, consisting of an undrawn committed $8.0 billion credit 
facility and $4.0 billion of standby facilities. $7.8 billion of the credit facility was available for one year and $0.2 billion was available for less than 1 year. 
$3.9 billion of the standby facilities were available for 3 years and $0.1 billion were available for 2 years. These facilities were unutilized and were held with 
27 international banks. In January 2025, the committed credit facility and standby facilities were replaced by new borrowing facilities, consisting of an 
undrawn committed $8.0 billion credit facility and $4.0 billion of standby facilities. These new facilities are available for 5 years, are held with 33 
international banks and borrowings via these facilities would be at pre-agreed rates 
For further information on the group's sources and uses of cash see Liquidity and capital resources on page 316. 
The group manages liquidity risk associated with derivative contracts, other than derivative hedging instruments, based on the expected maturities of both 
derivative assets and liabilities as indicated in Note 30. Management does not currently anticipate any cash flows, other than noted below, that could be of 
a significantly different amount or could occur earlier than the expected maturity analysis provided.

30. Derivative financial instruments 
In the ordinary course of business the group enters into derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage its normal business exposures in relation 
to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt, 
consistent with its risk management policies and objectives. An outline of the group’s financial risks and the objectives and policies pursued in relation to 
those risks is set out in Note 29. Additionally, the group has a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation that is undertaken in conjunction with 
these activities using a similar range of contracts.
For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to the valuation of derivatives see Derivative financial instruments within Note 1.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments at 31 December are set out below.
Exchange traded derivatives are valued using closing prices provided by the exchange as at the balance sheet date. These derivatives are categorized 
within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Exchange traded derivatives are typically considered settled through the (normally daily) payment or receipt of 
variation margin.
Over-the-counter (OTC) financial swaps, forwards and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are generally valued using readily available 
information in the public markets and quotations provided by brokers and price index developers. These quotes are corroborated with market data and are 
categorized within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
In certain less liquid markets, or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available. In these circumstances, OTC financial swaps and 
physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships between 
various commodities, and that result in management’s best estimate of fair value. These contracts are categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.Financial statements

Financial OTC and physical commodity options are valued using industry standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward 
prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic factors. The 
degree to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets determines whether the option is categorized within level 2 or level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy.

The group maintains active trading positions in a variety of derivatives. The contracts may be entered into for risk management purposes, to satisfy supply 
requirements or for entrepreneurial trading. Certain contracts are classified as held for trading, regardless of their original business objective, and are 
recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. Trading activities are undertaken by using a range of contract types 
in combination to create incremental gains by arbitraging prices between markets, locations and time periods. The net of these exposures is monitored 
using market value-at-risk techniques as described in Note 29.

The amount recognized in the income statement for the year relating to level 3 held-for-trading derivatives still held at 31 December 2024 was a $193 
million loss (2023 $631 million gain related to derivatives still held at 31 December 2023 ). 
Derivative gains and losses
The group enters into derivative contracts including futures, options, swaps and certain forward sales and forward purchases contracts, relating to both 
currency and commodity trading activities. Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and 
entrepreneurial trading. They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair 
valued under accounting standards. These gains and losses are included within sales and other operating revenues in the income statement. Also included 
within this line item are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes. The total amount relating to all these items was a net gain of $9,726 
million (2023 $19,786 million net gain). This number does not include gains and losses on the change in value of contracts which are not recognized under 
IFRS such as transportation and storage contracts, but does include the associated financially settled contracts. The net amounts for actual gains and 
losses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above.
As outlined in Note 1 - Significant estimate and judgement: derivative financial instruments, LNG contracts are only recognised in the financial statements 
when associated cargoes are lifted. The embedded value in these contracts is not recognised and is subject to underlying commodity price volatility. bp 
generally price risk manages the exposure to LNG cargoes due for delivery in the near term where there is a liquid market. It does so on a portfolio basis 
using derivative instruments amongst other price risk management strategies. Under IFRS, these derivative instruments, which are subject to similar price 
volatility, are recorded at fair value through profit and loss at each reporting period, which creates an accounting mismatch in the financial statements 
between the accounting for LNG contracts and the derivatives used for risk management. For the year ended 31 December 2024, there were no material 
gains or losses recorded on the associated derivative positions. For the year ended 31 December 2023, there were material gains recognized on the 
associated derivative positions due to the movement in the underlying commodity prices. . For additional information, details of management’s internal 
measure of performance are given in the Group Performance Report on page 24 and on page 314.
The group also enters into derivative contracts relating to foreign currency risk management activities including contracts that the group has entered into 
to manage the foreign currency exposure relating to the non-US dollar hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods. The change in the unrealized value 
of these contracts was a net loss of $404 million (2023 $632 million net gain and 2022 $1,280 million net loss). Where the derivative is economically 
hedging finance debt, gains and losses on such derivative contracts are included within finance costs. Where the derivative is managing non-US hybrid 
bond exposure gains and loss are included within production and manufacturing expenses. Where these gains and losses arise on derivatives hedging 
finance debt they are largely offset by opposing net foreign exchange differences on retranslation of the associated non-US dollar debt. The net amounts 
for actual gains and losses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above. 
Cash flow hedges
(i) Foreign currency risk of highly probable forecast capital expenditure
At 31 December 2024, the group held currency forwards designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of highly probable forecast 
non-US dollar capital expenditure. Note 29 outlines the group’s approach to foreign currency exchange risk management. When the highly probable 
forecast capital expenditure designated as a hedged item occurs, a non-financial asset is recognized and is presented within the fixed asset section of the 
balance sheet. 
The group claims hedge accounting only for the spot value of the currency exposure in line with the strategy to fix the volatility in the spot exchange rate 
element. The fair value on the instrument attributable to forward points and foreign currency basis spreads is taken immediately to the income statement. 
204 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

30. Derivative financial instruments – continued
The group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The existence of an 
economic relationship is determined at inception and prospectively by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged 
item. The group enters into hedging derivatives that match the currency and notional of the hedged items on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is 
determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional designated on the forecast transaction. The group determines the extent 
to which it hedges highly probable forecast capital expenditures on a project by project basis.
The group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material:
•counterparty's credit risk, the group mitigates counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with high credit quality counterparties; and
•differences in settlement timing between the derivative and hedged items. The latter impacts the discount factor used in the calculation of the hedge 
ineffectiveness. The group mitigates differences in timing between the derivatives and hedged items by applying a rolling strategy and by hedging 
currency pairs from stable economies. The group's cash flow hedge designations are highly effective as the sources of ineffectiveness identified are 
expected to result in minimal hedge ineffectiveness.
The group has not designated any net positions as hedged items in cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk.
(ii) Commodity price risk of highly probable forecast sales
During the period the group held Henry Hub NYMEX futures designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of certain highly probable 
forecast future sales. Henry Hub NYMEX futures are subject to daily settlement, where their fair value at the end of each day is required to be cash settled, 
such that the carrying amount of these hedging instruments within continuing hedge relationships is always zero at the end of each day.
The group is exposed to the variability in the gas price, but only applied hedge accounting to the risk of Henry Hub price movements for a percentage of 
future gas sales from its BPX Energy business.
The group applied hedge accounting in relation to these highly probable future sales where there was an economic relationship between the hedged item 
and hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship was determined at inception and prospectively by comparing the critical terms of the 
hedging instrument and those of the hedged item. The group entered into hedging derivatives that matched the notional amounts of the hedged items on a 
1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio was determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount designated on the 
forecast transaction.
The hedge was highly effective due to the price index of the hedging instruments matching the price index of the hedged item. The group did not designate 
any net positions as hedged items in cash flow hedges of commodity price risk.
The tables below summarize the change in the fair value of hedging instruments and the hedged item used to calculate ineffectiveness in the period.

Fair value hedges 
At 31 December 2024, the group held interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk and foreign 
currency risk arising from group fixed rate debt issuances. Note 29 outlines the group’s approach to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk 
management. The interest rate swaps are used to convert US dollar denominated fixed rate borrowings into floating rate debt. The cross-currency interest 
rate swaps are used to convert sterling, euro, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone denominated fixed rate 
borrowings into US dollar floating rate debt. The group manages all risks derived from debt issuance, such as credit risk, however, the group applies hedge 
accounting only to certain components of interest rate and foreign currency risk in order to minimize hedge ineffectiveness. The interest rate and foreign 
currency exposures are identified and hedged on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
For interest rate exposures, the group designates as a fair value hedge the benchmark interest rate component only. This is an observable and reliably 
measurable component of interest rate risk. For foreign currency exposures, the group excludes from the designation the foreign currency basis spread 
component implicit in the cross-currency interest rate swaps. This is separately calculated at hedge designation, is recognized in other comprehensive 
income over the life of the hedge and amortized to the income statement on a straight-line basis, in accordance with the group’s policy on costs of 
hedging.

30. Derivative financial instruments – continued
The group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. The existence of an 
economic relationship is determined initially by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item and it is prospectively 
assessed using linear regression analysis. The group issues fixed rate debt and enters into interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps with critical 
terms that match those of the debt and on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with 
the notional amount of the debt. The hedge relationship is designated for the full term and notional value of the debt. Both the hedging instrument and the 
hedged item are expected to be held to maturity.
The group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material: 
•derivative counterparty’s credit risk which is not offset by the hedged item. This risk is mitigated by entering into derivative transactions only with high 
credit quality counterparties; and
•sensitivity to interest rate between the hedged item and the derivatives. This is driven by differences in payment frequencies between the instrument 
and the bond. 
The tables below summarize the change in the fair value of hedging instruments and the hedged item used to calculate ineffectiveness in the period. The 
signage convention for changes in fair value presented in this table is consistent with that presented in Note 27.

bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 215

32. Capital and reserves – continued
Share capital
The balance on the share capital account represents the aggregate nominal value of all ordinary and preference shares in issue, including treasury shares.
Share premium account
The balance on the share premium account represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary and preference shares.
Capital redemption reserve
The balance on the capital redemption reserve represents the aggregate nominal value of all the ordinary shares repurchased and cancelled.
Merger reserve
The balance on the merger reserve represents the premium arising where the fair value of the consideration given is in excess of the nominal value of the 
ordinary shares issued in an acquisition made by the issue of shares where merger relief under the Companies Act applies.
Treasury shares
Treasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes shares held in Employee Share 
Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and bp’s US share plan administrator to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in 
the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as treasury shares. The ESOPs are funded by the group and 
have waived their rights to dividends in respect of such shares held for future awards. Until such time as the shares held by the ESOPs vest unconditionally 
to employees, the amount paid for those shares is shown as a reduction in shareholders’ equity. Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as 
assets and liabilities of the group.
Investments in equity instruments
This reserve records the change in fair value of investments in equity instruments for which the group has elected to recognize fair value gains and losses 
in other comprehensive income.
Foreign currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations. Upon 
disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are reclassified to the income statement. 
Cash flow hedges
This reserve records the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge. For further 
information on the accounting for cash flow hedges see Note 1 - Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.
Costs of hedging 
This reserve records the change in fair value of the foreign currency basis spread of financial instruments to which cost of hedge accounting has been 
applied. The accumulated amount relates to time-period related hedged items and is amortized to profit or loss over the term of the hedging relationship. 
For further information on the accounting for costs of hedging see Note 1 - Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.
Profit and loss account
The balance held on this reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the group.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to bp shareholders. Included within non-
controlling interests are perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds, perpetual subordinated hybrid securities and certain equity instruments with preferred 
distributions issued by group subsidiaries. The contractual terms of these instruments allow the group to defer coupon payments, equity distributions and 
repayment of principal indefinitely. However, the terms and conditions of each instrument stipulate the circumstances in which deferred payments and/or 
the principal amount of the instrument becomes payable. These circumstances, which include the announcement of a bp p.l.c. ordinary share or parity 
equity dividend distribution, are within the group’s control.
Perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds are issued by BP Capital Markets p.l.c., a group subsidiary, in euro, sterling and US dollars. During the year BP Capital 
Markets p.l.c. voluntarily bought back $1.3 billion of the non-call 2025 4.375% US dollar hybrid bonds issued in 2020 and issued euro, sterling and US dollar 
hybrid bonds for a US dollar equivalent amount of $3.9 billion. Coupons on the new issuances are fixed for an initial period up to dates from 2030 to 2035 
at rates of 4.375% to 6.45%. As at 31 December 2024 the total population of hybrid bonds include redemption options exercisable at the group’s discretion 
from June 2025 to March 2035 (the first ‘call date’), on specified dates thereafter, or in the event of specific circumstances (such as a change in IFRS or 
tax regime) as set out in the individual terms of each issue. Coupons are fixed for an initial period up to dates from September 2025 to June 2035 at rates 
of 3.25% to 6.45% and reset to rates determined by the contractual terms of each instrument on certain dates thereafter. Whilst the contractual terms of 
these instruments allow the group to defer coupon payments and the repayment of principal indefinitely, the group has chosen to swap the non-US dollar 
hybrid bonds to a USD floating interest rate up to their respective first call periods. Payments made to and profit attributed to these hybrid bonds in the 
year totalled $485 million (2023 $477 million) and $517 million (2023 $473 million) respectively. The amount of hybrid bonds included in non-controlling 
interests at the end of the year was $14.6 billion (2023 $12.1 billion).
Perpetual subordinated hybrid securities issued by group subsidiaries include $500 million issued during 2024, specifically earmarked to fund BP 
Alternative Energy Investments Ltd including the funding of Lightsource bp. Payments made to and profit attributed to perpetual hybrid securities in the 
year totalled $125 million (2023 $114 million) and $125 million (2023 $113 million) respectively. The amount of perpetual subordinated hybrid securities 
included within non-controlling interests at the end of the year was $2.0 billion (2023 $1.5 billion).
Equity instruments with preferred distributions issued by group subsidiaries include $1,330 million issued during 2024 comprising $500 million of proceeds 
from the sale of a 49% interest in a subsidiary that holds certain midstream assets offshore US; and $830 million of proceeds from the sale of a 25% non-
controlling interest in BP Pipelines TAP Limited, the bp subsidiary that holds a 20% share in Trans Adriatic Pipeline AG. In both transactions, the group 
retains control over the ability to defer equity distributions which are not guaranteed, and investors have no right to redeem their shares other than in 
certain circumstances that are within the group’s control. The amount associated with equity instruments with preferred distributions included within non-
controlling interests at the end of the year was approximately $1.3 billion (2023 $0.3 billion).

33. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings 
Contingent liabilities
There were contingent liabilities at 31 December 2024 in respect of guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course of the group’s 
business. No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities. Further information on financial guarantees is included in Note 29.
In the normal course of the group’s business, bp group entities are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings arising out of current and past operations, 
including matters related to commercial disputes, product liability, antitrust, commodities trading, premises-liability claims, consumer protection, general 
health, safety, climate change and environmental claims and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances, such as lead pigment in paint, 
asbestos and other chemicals. The amounts claimed could be significant and could be material to the group’s results of operations, financial position or 
liquidity. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, bp expects that the impact of current legal and regulatory proceedings on the 
group‘s results of operations, liquidity or financial position will not be material.
The group files tax returns in many jurisdictions across the world. Various tax authorities are currently examining these returns, which contain matters that 
could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. The resolution of tax positions through negotiations with relevant tax 
authorities, or through litigation, can take several years to complete and the amounts could be significant and could, in aggregate, be material to the 
group’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, bp does not expect there to 
be any material impact upon the group‘s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Financial statements

33. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings – continued
The group is subject to numerous national and local health, safety and environmental laws and regulations concerning its products, operations and other 
activities. These laws and regulations may require the group to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release 
of chemicals or petroleum substances by the group or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites including refineries, chemical plants, oil 
fields, commodities extraction sites, service stations, terminals and waste disposal sites. In addition, the group may have obligations relating to prior asset 
sales or closed facilities. The ultimate requirement for remediation and its costs are inherently difficult to estimate. However, the estimated cost of 
environmental obligations has been provided in these accounts in accordance with the group‘s accounting policies. While the amounts of future possible 
costs that are not provided for could be significant and material to the group‘s results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, it is not 
possible to estimate the amounts involved. bp does not expect these costs to have a material impact on the group’s results of operations, financial 
position or liquidity.
If production and manufacturing facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties and the subsequent owner is unable to meet their decommissioning 
obligations it is possible that, in certain circumstances, bp could be partially or wholly responsible for decommissioning. The group estimates that for 
production facilities, approximately $16 billion (2023 $16 billion) of associated decommissioning obligations were previously transferred to third parties. 
While the amounts associated with decommissioning provisions reverting to the group could be material, bp is not currently aware of any such material 
cases that have a greater than remote chance of reverting to the group. Furthermore, as described in Provisions and contingencies within Note 1, 
decommissioning provisions associated with customers & products facilities are not generally recognized as the potential obligations cannot be measured 
given their indeterminate settlement dates.
By their nature, it is not practicable to estimate the potential financial impact or possible timing of the above contingencies as there are significant 
uncertainties that are dependent on various factors that are not within the group’s control.
Contingent liabilities related to the Gulf of America oil spill
For information on legal proceedings relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, see Legal proceedings below. Any outstanding Deepwater Horizon related 
claims are not expected to have a material impact on the group's financial performance.
Legal proceedings
Proceedings relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill
Introduction
BP Exploration & Production Inc. (BPXP) was lease operator of Mississippi Canyon, Block 252 in the Gulf of America, where the semi-submersible rig 
Deepwater Horizon was deployed at the time of the 20 April 2010 explosion and fire and resulting oil spill (the Incident). Lawsuits and claims arising from 
the Incident were brought principally in US federal and state courts. The remaining proceedings arising from the Incident are discussed below. 
Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement
In 2012 the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement (Medical Settlement) was entered into with the plaintiffs steering committee. It includes an exclusive 
remedy provision regarding class members pursuing exposure-based personal injury claims for later-manifested physical conditions (LMPCs). As of 31 
December 2024, there were 26 pending lawsuits brought by class members claiming LMPCs. 
Other civil complaints – personal injury
The vast majority of post-explosion clean-up, medical monitoring and personal injury claims from individuals that either opted out of the Medical 
Settlement and/or were excluded from that settlement have been dismissed (including more than 620 cases in which the courts granted BPXP’s motions 
for summary judgment). As of 31 December 2024, 38 cases remained pending in the district courts. 
Non-US government lawsuits
Two class actions are pending in Mexican Federal District Courts against various bp group entities including BPXP and BP America Production Company 
by separate plaintiff classes. Although the two actions are separate, both broadly seek penalties, damages and compensation for alleged environmental, 
health and economic harm in Mexico as a result of the Incident. One of the actions also seeks an order requiring the bp defendants to repair alleged 
damage to Mexican waters and land.
bp has answered the complaints in both actions by seeking dismissal on various grounds including that no oil reached Mexican waters or land and there 
was no economic or environmental harm in Mexico. 
These legal actions remain at a relatively early stage and while it is not possible to predict the outcome, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends 
to defend such actions vigorously.

33. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings – continued
Other legal proceedings
Climate change 
BP p.l.c., BP America Inc. and BP Products North America Inc. are co-defendants with other oil and gas companies in approximately 30 lawsuits brought in 
various state and federal courts on behalf of various governmental and private parties. The lawsuits generally assert claims under a variety of legal 
theories seeking to hold the defendant companies responsible for impacts allegedly caused by and/or relating to climate change. Underlying many of the 
legal theories are allegations regarding deceptive communication and disinformation to the public. The lawsuits seek remedies including payment of 
money and other forms of equitable relief. If such suits were successful, the cost of the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial. 
Defendants spent several years seeking to have the cases removed to federal courts, however Defendants’ attempts were ultimately unsuccessful. 
Accordingly, the cases are proceeding in various state courts. As a group, the lawsuits generally remain at relatively early stages in the litigation process. 
While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.
Louisiana Coastal restoration
Six coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed over 40 separate lawsuits in state courts in Louisiana against various oil and gas companies 
seeking damages for coastal erosion. bp entities were named defendants in 17 of these cases. The lawsuits allege that the defendants' historical 
operations in oil and gas fields within the Louisiana onshore coastal zone failed to comply with state permits and/or were conducted without the required 
coastal use permits. The scope and scale of plaintiffs’ damages demands are significant and unprecedented, including substantial remediation costs, 
natural resource (ecological impact) damages and the claimed costs for restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil and gas field operations.
Defendants removed all of these lawsuits to federal court and the removals were contested by plaintiffs, eventually resulting in a decision from the US Fifth 
Circuit Court of Appeals rejecting defendants’ “federal officer” jurisdiction removal grounds in one of two lead cases – Plaquemines Parish v. Riverwood, et 
al.  Defendants’ petition for writ of certiorari to the US Supreme Court seeking review of the US Fifth Circuit’s Riverwood decision was denied in early 2023. 
In 2024, the US Fifth Circuit issued a further final ruling rejecting “federal officer” jurisdiction in a subset of the removed cases contested on a related 
removal theory and remanded all such cases to state district court. 
Following remand of the other lead removal case, Cameron Parish v. Auster, et. al., in which bp was the principal defendant, bp entered into a settlement 
agreement and release with the plaintiffs in late 2023 in respect of all state and local governmental claims arising within Cameron Parish. The terms of the 
settlement agreement and release are confidential and have not had and are not expected to have in the future, a significant effect on the company’s 
financial position or profitability.   
Atlantic Richfield Company, a bp affiliate, was a named defendant along with other oil & gas companies in a case, Plaquemines Parish v. Rozel, et al, set for 
trial in March 2025. A state trial court in December 2024 ruled in favour of Atlantic Richfield’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed it from the 
case, but following a motion by plaintiffs for reconsideration, the court reversed its summary judgment ruling and reinstated Atlantic Richfield as a 
defendant. The plaintiffs’ claims against Atlantic Richfield have been severed from the initial March 2025 trial date, and the court has yet to establish a new 
trial date for the plaintiffs’ now separate claims against Atlantic Richfield.
No bp entity is a named defendant in any of the other active Louisiana Coastal restoration docket cases with a trial date, all of which remain in the early 
stages of litigation. In addition, four private landowners have filed separate claims in the state courts in Jefferson and Plaquemines Parishes of Louisiana 
for restoration damages related to alleged impacts to their marshlands associated with historic oil field operations. bp entities are defendants in two of 
these private landowner cases, having been previously dismissed from a third.
While it is not possible to predict the outcomes of these novel legal actions, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions 
vigorously.Financial statements

On 26 February 2025, bp announced a fundamentally reset strategy, with significant capital reallocation, and plans to drive improved performance, aimed 
at growing free cash flow, returns and long-term shareholder value. This strategy will see bp grow its upstream oil and gas business, focus its downstream 
business, and invest with increasing discipline into the transition. It builds on bp’s distinct strengths and competitive advantages as an integrated energy 
company. There are no impacts on these financial statements related to the strategy announcements in accordance with IAS 10 ‘Events after the reporting

Supplementary information on oil and natural gas (unaudited)
The regional analysis presented below is on a continent basis, with separate disclosure for countries that contain 15% or more of the total proved reserves 
(for subsidiaries plus equity-accounted entitiesa), in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements.
Oil and gas reserves – certain definitions
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the following terms have the meanings shown below:
Proved oil and gas reserves
Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable 
certainty to be economically producible – from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, 
and government regulations – prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is 
reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must 
have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
(i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
(A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any; and
(B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically 
producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
(ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration 
unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, 
proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and 
reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
(iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are 
included in the proved classification when:
(A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favourable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of 
an installed programme in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty 
of the engineering analysis on which the project or programme was based; and
(B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the 
average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic 
average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding 
escalations based upon future conditions.
Undeveloped oil and gas reserves
Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing 
wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production 
when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are 
scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.
(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other 
improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an 
analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
Developed oil and gas reserves
Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
(i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared 
to the cost of a new well; and
(ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not 
involving a well.
For details on bp’s proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes, see pages 318-326.

Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes therein relating to proved oil and gas reserves
The following tables set out the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, and changes therein, relating to crude oil and natural gas 
production from the group’s estimated proved reserves. This information is prepared in compliance with FASB Oil and Gas Disclosures requirements.
Future net cash flows have been prepared on the basis of certain assumptions which may or may not be realized. These include the timing of future 
production, the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves and the application of average crude oil and natural gas prices and exchange rates from 
the previous 12 months. Furthermore, both proved reserves estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information 
becomes available and economic conditions change. bp cautions against relying on the information presented because of the highly arbitrary nature of the 
assumptions on which it is based and its lack of comparability with the historical cost information presented in the financial statements.

Productive oil and gas wells and acreage
The following tables show the number of gross and net productive oil and natural gas wells and total gross and net developed and undeveloped oil and 
natural gas acreage in which the group and its equity-accounted entities had interests as at 31 December 2024. A ‘gross’ well or acre is one in which a 
whole or fractional working interest is owned, while the number of ‘net’ wells or acres is the sum of the whole or fractional working interests in gross wells 
or acres. Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production. Developed acreage is the acreage within the boundary of a field, on which 
development wells have been drilled, which could produce the reserves; while undeveloped acres are those on which wells have not been drilled or 
completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities, whether or not such acres contain proved reserves.

Notes on financial statements
1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions
Authorization of financial statements and statement of compliance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ (FRS 101) 
The financial statements of BP p.l.c. for the year ended 31 December 2024 were approved and signed by the chief executive officer on 6 March 2025 
having been duly authorized to do so by the board of directors. The company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 
100 ‘Application of Financial Reporting Requirements’ (FRS 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, these financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006. 
Basis of preparation  
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting 
standards. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration 
given in exchange for the assets. 
As permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in relation to: 
(a) the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, 111 and 134 to 136 of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial 
Statements’; 
(b) the requirements of IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows' (excluding paragraphs 1 to 44E, 44H(b)(ii) and 45 to 63 which are not applicable’; 
(c) the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’ in relation to standards not yet 
effective; 
(d) the requirements of paragraphs 17 and 18A of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’; 
(e) the requirements of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, 
provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member;
(f) the requirements of paragraphs 130(f)(ii), 130(f)(iii), 134(d) to 134(f) and 135(c)-135(e) of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets;
(g) the requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment';
(h) the requirements of IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’; and
(i) the requirement of the second sentence of paragraph 110 and paragraphs 113(a), 114,115, 118, 119(a) to (c), 120 to 127 and 129 of IFRS 15 'Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers'. 
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements of BP p.l.c. 
The financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars ($ million), except where otherwise indicated. 
There are no new IFRS Accounting Standards or amended standards or interpretations adopted from 1 January 2024 onwards that have a significant 
impact on the financial statements. 
IFRS 18 ‘Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements’ will supersede IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027 subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. IFRS 18 (and consequential amendments made to 
IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’, IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies: Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’, IAS 33 ‘Earnings per share’ and IFRS 7  ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’) introduces several new requirements that are expected to impact the presentation and disclosure of the Company's financial 
statements. These new requirements include: 
• Requirements to classify all income and expenses included in the statement of profit or loss into one of five categories and to present two new 
mandatory subtotals.
• Required disclosures about certain non-GAAP measures (‘management defined performance measures’) in a single note to the financial statements.
• Enhanced guidance on the aggregation of information across all the primary financial statements and the notes.
The Company’s evaluation of the effect of adopting IFRS 18 is ongoing.
Material accounting policy information: use of judgements, estimates and assumptions  
Inherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements is the need for bp management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The accounting judgements 
and estimates that have a significant impact on the results of the Company are set out in boxed text below, and should be read in conjunction with the 
information provided in the Notes on financial statements.
The areas requiring the most significant judgement and estimation in the preparation of the financial statements are the recoverability of investment 
carrying values and pensions. Judgements and estimates, not all of which are significant, made in assessing the impact of the current economic and 
geopolitical environment, and climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy on the financial statements are also set out in boxed text 
below. Where an estimate has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year this is specifically noted within the boxed text.

Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy
Climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy were considered in preparing the financial statements. These may have significant impacts 
on the currently reported amounts of the Company's assets and liabilities discussed below.
Impairment of investments
The recoverable amounts of the Company’s investments in subsidiaries are closely linked to the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and 
goodwill in the individual subsidiaries. The energy transition is likely to impact the future prices of commodities such as oil and natural gas which in turn 
may affect the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and goodwill in the oil and gas industry. Management’s best estimate of oil and 
natural gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment testing were revised during 2024. The revised price assumptions have been rebased in real 
2023 terms and are materially consistent with the disclosed prices in real 2022 terms. The near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per 
barrel to reflect near-term supply constraints before declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy 
system decarbonizes, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00 
per mmBtu reflecting an assumption that declining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. The revised assumptions for Brent oil 
and Henry Hub gas sit within the range of external scenarios considered by management and are in line with a range of transition paths consistent with 
the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-
industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of the geopolitical and economic environment
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the following areas involving judgement and estimates were identified as most relevant with regards 
to the impact of the current geopolitical and economic environment. 
Going concern
Liquidity and financing is managed within bp under pooled group-wide arrangements which include the Company. As part of assuring the going concern 
basis of preparation for the Company, the ability and intent of the bp group to support the Company has been taken into consideration. The most recent 
bp group financial statements (see pages 115 to 222) continue to be prepared on a going concern basis. Forecast liquidity has been assessed under a 
number of stressed scenarios, including a significant decline in oil prices over the 12-month period. Reverse stress tests performed indicated that the 
group will continue to operate as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements even if the 
Brent price fell to zero. In addition, group management of bp have confirmed that the existing intra-group funding and liquidity arrangements as currently 
constituted are expected to continue for the foreseeable future, being no less than twelve months from the approval of these financial statements. No 
material uncertainties over going concern or significant judgements or estimates in the assessment were identified. Accordingly, the Company will be 
able to draw on support from the bp group for the foreseeable future and these financial statements have therefore been prepared on the going concern 
basis. 
Pensions  
The volatility in the financial markets during 2024 impacted the assumptions used for determining the fair value of plan assets and the present value of 
defined benefit obligations in the group’s defined benefit pension plans. See significant estimate: pensions and Note 4 for further information.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable 
amount. Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. Where these circumstances have reversed, the impairment previously made is reversed to the extent of the original cost of the 
investment.
Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values  
Determination as to whether, and by how much, an investment holding company chain (defined as each direct subsidiary and its own investments), is 
impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount 
rates, capital expenditure, carbon pricing (where applicable), production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the 
outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Determination as to whether, and by 
how much, an asset or CGU is impaired involves similar estimates.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of disposal may be 
determined based on expected sales proceeds or similar recent market transaction data. Details of impairment charges recognized in the profit and loss 
account and the carrying amounts of investments are shown in Note 2. The estimates for assumptions made in impairment tests in 2024 relating to 
discount rates and oil and gas properties are discussed below. It is impracticable to reliably determine the extent of any impacts of changes in the 
assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of the company’s investments given the diverse characteristics of the underlying assets and 
the interdependency of the various inputs. Changes in the economic environment including as a result of the energy transition or other facts and 
circumstances may necessitate revisions to these assumptions and could result in a material change to the carrying values of the group's assets within 
the next financial year. Financial statements

bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 255

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Discount rates
For discounted cash flow calculations, future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the CGU. Value-in-use calculations are typically discounted 
using a pre-tax discount rate based upon the cost of funding the Company derived from an established model, adjusted to a pre-tax basis and 
incorporating a market participant capital structure and country risk premiums. Fair value less costs of disposal discounted cash flow calculations use a 
post-tax discount rate.
The discount rates applied in impairment tests are reassessed each year and, in 2024, the post-tax discount rate was 8% (2023 8%) other than for 
renewable power assets. Where the CGU is located in a country that was judged to be higher risk, an additional premium of 1% to 3% was reflected in the 
post-tax discount rate (2023 1% to 4%). The judgement of classifying a country as higher risk and the applicable premium takes into account various 
economic and geopolitical factors. The pre-tax discount rate, other than for renewable power assets, typically ranged from 9% to 20% (2023 9% to 20%) 
depending on the risk premium and applicable tax rate in the geographic location of the CGU. For renewable power assets, which were tested primarily 
on a fair-value basis in 2024 (including those in equity accounted entities) tests were performed using a post-tax cost of equity-based discount rate range 
of 8.75% to 9.5%. In 2023, tests were performed on a value-in-use basis using a post-tax WACC-based discount rate of 6.5%.
Oil and natural gas properties
For upstream oil and natural gas properties in subsidiaries, expected future cash flows are estimated using management’s best estimate of future oil and 
natural gas prices, and production and reserves and certain resources volumes. The estimated future level of production in all impairment tests is based 
on assumptions about future commodity prices, production and development costs, field decline rates, current fiscal regimes and other factors. A 
change in the discount rate, reserves, resources or the oil and gas price assumptions in the next financial year may result in a recoverable amount of one 
or more of these assets above or below the current carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in that period. 
Management consider that reasonably possible changes in the discount rate or forecast revenue, arising from a change in oil and natural gas prices and/
or production could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year.
Oil and natural gas prices
The price assumptions used for value-in-use impairment testing are based on those used for investment appraisal. bp’s carbon emissions cost 
assumptions and their interrelationship with oil and gas prices are described in 'Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate 
change and the transition to a lower carbon economy' on page 145. The investment appraisal price assumptions are recommended by the senior vice 
president economic & energy insights after considering a range of external price sets, and supply and demand profiles associated with various energy 
transition scenarios. They are reviewed and approved by management. As a result of the current uncertainty over the pace of transition to lower-carbon 
supply and demand and the social, political and environmental actions that will be taken to meet the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, the 
scenarios considered include those where those goals are met as well as those where they are not met. 
During the year, bp's price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing were revised. The revised price assumptions have been rebased in real 
2023 terms and are materially consistent with the disclosed prices in real 2022 terms. The near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per 
barrel to reflect near term supply constraints before declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy 
system decarbonizes, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00 
per mmBtu reflecting an assumption that declining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. These price assumptions are derived 
from the central case investment appraisal assumptions (see page 20). A summary of the group’s revised price assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub 
gas, applied in 2024 and 2023, in real 2023 terms, is provided below. The assumptions represent management’s best estimate of future prices at the 
balance sheet date, which sit within the range of external scenarios considered as appropriate for the purpose. They are considered by bp to be in line 
with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average 
temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 
However, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. Inflation rate of 2% - 2.5% (2023 2%) is applied to determine the price 
assumptions in nominal terms.

Oil and natural gas reserves
 
In addition to oil and natural gas prices, significant technical and commercial assessments are required to determine the Company’s estimated oil and 
natural gas reserves. Reserves estimates are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, 
reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity and drilling of new wells all impact on the determination of the Company’s estimates of 
its oil and natural gas reserves. bp bases its reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial 
assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements. 
Reserves assumptions for value-in-use tests reflect the reserves and resources that management currently intend to develop. The recoverable amount of 
oil and gas properties is determined using a combination of inputs including reserves, resources and production volumes. Risk factors may be applied to 
reserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved or probable.

Foreign currency translation 
The functional and presentation currency of the financial statements is US dollars. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional 
currency of those entities at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the 
income statement. Non-monetary items, other than those measured at fair value, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition.
Exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by a non-US dollar functional currency branch are 
translated into US dollars and are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other comprehensive income. Income statement 
transactions are translated into US dollars using the average exchange rate for the reporting period. 
Financial guarantees
The Company enters into financial guarantee contracts with its subsidiaries. The liability for a financial guarantee contract is initially measured at fair value 
and subsequently measured at the higher of the contract’s estimated expected credit loss and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, 
cumulative amortization.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits 
The defined benefit pension plans are plans that share risks between entities under common control. In each instance BP p.l.c. is the principal employer 
and carries the whole plan surplus or deficit on its balance sheet. The cost of providing benefits under the Company’s defined benefit plans is determined 
separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service 
cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation. Past service costs, resulting from either a plan 
amendment or a curtailment (a reduction in future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership), are recognized immediately 
when the company becomes committed to a change.
Net interest expense relating to pensions and other post-employment benefits, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in 
present value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the 
present value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected 
changes in the obligation or plan assets during the year. 
Remeasurements of the defined benefit liability and asset, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts 
included in net interest described above) are recognized within other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently 
reclassified to profit and loss.
The defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit recognized on the balance sheet for each plan comprises the difference between the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds) and the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations 
are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. Defined benefit 
pension plan surpluses are only recognized to the extent they are recoverable, either by way of a refund from the plan or reductions in future contributions 
to the plan.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.
Significant estimate: pensions and other post-employment benefits
Accounting for defined benefit pensions involves making significant estimates when measuring the Company's pension plan surpluses and deficits. 
These estimates require assumptions to be made about many uncertainties.
Pension assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year. These assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation at 
the year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the company’s balance sheet, and pension expense for the following year. The 
assumptions used are provided in Note 4.
The assumptions that are the most significant to the amounts reported are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality levels. Assumptions about these 
variables are based on the environment in each country. The assumptions used vary from year to year, with resultant effects on future net income and 
net assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying 
amounts of the company’s pension obligations within the next financial year for the UK plan. Any differences between these assumptions and the actual 
outcome will also affect future net income and net assets. 
The values ascribed to these assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation 
used are provided in Note 4.
Income taxes
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. 
Income tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it is determined 
in accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities. It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or 
deductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Financial statements

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be realized in the future. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not 
discounted. See Note 6 for further details.
In July 2023, the UK government enacted legislation to implement the Pillar Two Model rules. The legislation is effective for bp from 1 January 2024 and 
includes an income inclusion rule and a domestic minimum tax, which together are designed to ensure a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in each 
country in which bp operates. Similar legislation is being enacted by other governments around the world. In line with the amendments to IAS 12, the 
exception from recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes has been applied.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. In the case of financial assets not measured at fair value through 
profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs are also included. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as 
set out below. The Company derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the rights to receive cash flows have 
been transferred to a third party and either substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred, or substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset have neither been retained nor transferred but control of the asset has been transferred.
Financial assets measured at amortized cost
Financial assets are classified as measured at amortized cost when they are held in a business model the objective of which is to collect contractual cash 
flows and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Such assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective 
interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the assets are derecognized or impaired 
and when interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. This category of financial assets includes receivables.
Cash equivalents
Cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and generally have a maturity of three months or less from the 
date of acquisition. Cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost or, in the case of certain money market funds, fair value 
through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities 
All financial liabilities held by the Company are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities include other payables, 
accruals, and amounts payable to subsidiaries. The Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. 
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
All financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is 
typically equivalent to the fair value of the proceeds received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. 
After initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated 
by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation 
of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.

At 31 December 2024, the carrying amount of the company’s net assets of $123.5 billion (2023 $123.6 billion) exceeded the group’s market capitalisation 
of $79.6 billion (2023 $102.2 billion). As a result, management performed an impairment test of the company's major investments in line with the 
requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Management considered the performance of investments and impairment tests performed by the 
company’s subsidiaries. Taking into account the decrease in the group’s market capitalisation and an increase in the deficits between the carrying amount 
of the company’s major investments compared with the underlying net assets, compared to 2023, management concluded that an impairment was 
required, relating to deterioration of value in use and fair value less cost to sell. An impairment charge of $539 million were recognised against BP Global 
Investments Limited. Notwithstanding that there have been certain impairment reversals within some of the groups operating subsidiaries during the year, 
no reversals of previously recognised impairment provisions were determined to be required in respect of the company’s investments in subsidiaries.

4. Pensions
The defined benefit pension obligation consists primarily of a closed funded final salary pension plan in the UK under which retired employees draw the 
majority of their benefit as an annuity. This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated 
directors, four company-nominated directors, an independent director, and an independent chair nominated by the company. The trustee board is required 
by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan.  Employees 
in the UK are eligible for membership of defined contribution plans established with third-party providers. 
The level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due. 
For the primary UK defined benefit plan there is a funding agreement between the company and the trustee. On a three year cycle a schedule of 
contributions is agreed covering the next five years. The schedule of contributions is next scheduled to be updated after the 31 December 2026 formal 
actuarial valuation. No contractually committed funding was due at 31 December 2024. 
The surplus relating to the primary UK defined benefit plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any 
remaining assets once all members have left the plan.
The obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method. The date of the most recent 
actuarial review was 31 December 2024. The primary UK defined benefit plan is subject to a formal actuarial valuation every 3 years. The most recent 
formal actuarial valuation of the primary UK defined benefit plan was as at 31 December 2023.
The material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below. The assumptions are reviewed by 
management at the end of each year and are used to evaluate the accrued benefit obligation at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.
Financial assumptions used to determine benefit obligation %
2024 2023
Discount rate for plan liabilities  5.5  4.8 
Rate of increase for pensions in payment  2.9  2.8 
Rate of increase in deferred pensions  2.9  2.8 
Inflation for plan liabilities  3.1  3.0 
Financial assumptions used to determine benefit expense %
2024 2023
Discount rate for plan other finance expense  4.8  5.0 
The discount rate assumption is based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit 
payments. The inflation rate assumption is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds. The 
inflation assumption is used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an 
increase.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions. The mortality assumptions reflect best practice 
in the UK and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted to reflect the experience of the plans and an extrapolation of 
past longevity improvements into the future. For the main pension plan the mortality assumptions are as follows:
Mortality assumptions Years
2024 2023
Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60  27.0  27.4 
Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40  28.9  29.2 
Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60  29.0  29.2 
Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40  30.5  30.6 
The assets of the primary plan are held in a trust, the primary objective of which is to accumulate assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plan. The 
assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.
A proportion of the assets are held in equities, which are expected to generate a higher level of return over the long term, with an acceptable level of risk. In 
order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios 
are highly diversified.
The trustee’s long-term investment objective for the primary UK defined benefit plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same 
way as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk. To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment (LDI) 
approach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability 
assumptions of interest rate and inflation rate. This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money 
using existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date. The funds raised are used to invest in further 
bonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities. The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in 
the table below.
For the primary UK defined benefit plan there is an agreement with the trustee to at least maintain the proportion of assets with liability matching 
characteristics and review over time.  During 2024, the asset allocation policy remained unchanged.

Sensitivity analysis 
The discount rate, inflation and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the amounts reported. A one-percentage point change, in 
isolation, in certain assumptions as at 31 December 2024 for the company’s plans would have had the effects shown in the table below. The effects 
shown for the expense in 2025 comprise the total of current service cost and net finance income or expense.

b The amounts presented reflect the total impact of an inflation rate change on the assumptions for rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions.

(procedural matters) at a general meeting, shareholders present in person or by proxy have one vote each.
In the event of the winding up of the company, preference shareholders would be entitled to a sum equal to the capital paid up on the preference shares, 
plus an amount in respect of accrued and unpaid dividends and a premium equal to the higher of (i) 10% of the capital paid up on the preference shares 
and (ii) the excess of the average market price of such shares on the London Stock Exchange during the previous six months over par value.
During 2024 the company repurchased 1,238 million ordinary shares for a total consideration of $7,127 million, including transaction costs of $38 million. 
All shares purchased were for cancellation. The repurchased shares represented 7.4% of ordinary share capital. A further 176 million ordinary shares were 
repurchased between the end of the reporting period and 14 February 2025, the latest practicable date before the completion of these financial 
statements, for a total cost of $927 million of which $922 million has been accrued at 31 December 2024. The number of shares in issue is reduced when

Treasury shares 
Treasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes, shares held in Employee Share 
Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and by bp’s US share plan administrator to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are 
treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as treasury shares. The ESOPs are funded by the 
company and have waived their rights to dividends in respect of such shares held for future awards. Until such time as the shares held by the ESOPs vest 
unconditionally to employees, the amount paid for those shares is shown as a reduction in shareholders’ equity. Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are 
recognized as assets and liabilities of the company. 
Foreign currency translation reserve 
The foreign currency translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial information of the foreign currency 
branch. Upon disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are recycled to the income statement. 
Profit and loss account 
The balance held on this reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the company. 
The profit and loss account reserve includes $23,932 million (2023 $23,858 million), the distribution of which is limited by statutory or other restrictions. 
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 do not reflect the dividend announced on 11 February 2025 and which is expected to be 
paid on 28 March 2025; this will be treated as an appropriation of profit in the year ending 31 December 2025. 
9. Financial guarantees and other contingencies 
The company has issued guarantees to third parties and other bp subsidiaries in case of the failure, on the part of certain bp subsidiaries, to pay current 
liabilities and obligations pertaining to business operations. The amounts guaranteed by the company, at 31 December 2024, for these arrangements is 
$412 million (2023 $649 million). The company guarantees finance debt and lease obligations of certain bp group subsidiaries. Maturity dates vary and 
guarantees will terminate on full payment and/or cancellation of the obligation. As of 31 December 2024, maximum guaranteed amounts pertaining to 
debt and lease arrangements were $69,054 million (2023 $61,900 million). These maximum amounts are more than the actual guaranteed exposure of  
due at the balance sheet date as well as more than remaining obligations under the guaranteed contracts. The recognised liability due to provided financial 
guarantees was $854 million at the balance sheet date (2023 $865 million). The liability was included within Payables.
Performance under all the above guarantees would be triggered by a financial default of the guaranteed entity and, as such, are currently not expected to 
have any material effect.Financial statements

9. Financial guarantees and other contingencies – continued
As part of normal ongoing business operations and consistent with generally accepted industry practices, the company also executes contracts involving 
standard indemnities and guarantees for the respective businesses in which bp operates as well as indemnities specific to transactions, including the sale 
of businesses. This includes a guarantee of subsidiaries' liabilities under the Consent Decree between the United States, the Gulf states and bp and under 
the settlement agreement with the Gulf states in relation to the Gulf of America oil spill. The company has also issued uncapped guarantees for certain 
subsidiaries’ liabilities under the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee agreement relating to the Gulf of America oil spill. See Note 33 in the consolidated group 
financial statements of BP p.l.c. for further information. The company regularly evaluates the probability of having to incur costs associated with these 
indemnities and does not believe such matters will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and cash flow.
The company believes that guarantees and other off-balance sheet commitments do not currently, nor could reasonably have in the future, a material 
effect on its financial position, income and expenses, liquidity, investments or financial resources.

at growing free cash flow, returns and long-term shareholder value. This strategy will see bp grow its upstream oil and gas business, focus its downstream 
business, and invest with increasing discipline into the transition. It builds on bp’s distinct strengths and competitive advantages as an integrated energy 
company. There are no impacts on these financial statements related to the strategy announcements in accordance with IAS 10 ‘Events after the reporting

b Restructuring charges are classified as adjusting items where they relate to an announced major group restructuring. A major group restructuring is a restructuring programme affecting more than one of 
the group’s operating segments that is expected to result in charges of more than $1 billion over a defined period. 2024 includes charges for provisions arising from the groups transformation project that 
was announced on 16 January 2024. 2022 includes release of provisions for the reinvent bp restructuring costs. 
c Under IFRS bp marks-to-market the value of the hedges used to risk-manage LNG contracts, but not the contracts themselves, resulting in a mismatch in accounting treatment. The fair value accounting 
effect includes the change in value of LNG contracts that are being risk-managed, and the underlying result reflects how bp risk-manages its LNG contracts.
d For further information, including the nature of fair value accounting effects reported in each segment, see page 355.
e 2024 includes a $508 million gain relating to the remeasurement of bp's pre-existing 49.97% interest in Lightsource bp, and $498 million relating to the remeasurement of certain US assets excluded from 
the Lightsource bp acquisition (see Note 3 for further information). 2023 includes $1,140 million of impairment charges recognized through equity-accounted earnings relating to our US offshore wind 
projects.
f 2022 includes a provision reversal relating to the change in discount rate on retained decommissioning provisions. 
g 2024 includes $429 million of impairment charges recognized through equity-accounted earnings relating to our interest in Pan American Energy Group.
h For 2024, see Financial statements – Note 2 for further information.
i 2024 includes recognition of onerous contract provisions related to the Gelsenkirchen refinery. The unwind of these provisions will be reported as an adjusting item as the contractual obligations are 
settled.
j 2023 primarily relates to charges related to the control, abatement, clean-up or elimination of environmental pollution and legal settlements. 2022 primarily reflects charges due to the annual update of 
environmental provisions, including asbestos-related provisions for past operations, together with updates of non-Gulf of America oil spill related legal provisions. 
k For more information see Financial statements – Note 1 Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions – Investment in Rosneft, and Note 17 – Investments in associates.
l All periods presented include the unwinding of discounting effects relating to Gulf of America oil spill payables and the income statement impact of temporary valuation differences related to the group's 
interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management associated with finance debt. 2024 includes the unwinding of discounting effects relating to certain onerous contract provisions. 2023 and 
2022 include the income statement impact associated with the buyback of finance debt.
m Includes certain foreign exchange effects on tax as adjusting items. These amounts represent the impact of: (i) foreign exchange on deferred tax balances arising from the conversion of local currency tax 
base amounts into functional currency; and (ii) taxable gains and losses from the retranslation of US dollar-denominated intra-group loans to local currency.
n 2024 and 2023 include revisions to the deferred tax impact of the introduction of the UK Energy Profits Levy (EPL) on temporary differences existing at 31 December 2022 that are expected to unwind 
before 31 March 2028. 2022 includes the deferred tax impact of the introduction of the EPL. The EPL increases the headline rate of tax to 78% (75% until 31 October 2024) and applies to taxable profits Additional disclosures

from bp’s North Sea business made from 1 January 2023 until 31 March 2028. In October 2024 the UK government announced changes to the EPL including a 3% increase in the rate from 1 November 
2024, the removal of the Levy’s main investment allowance and an extension to 31 March 2030. The changes to the rate and to the investment allowance were substantively enacted in 2024. The 
extension of the Levy to 31 March 2030 was substantively enacted after 31 December 2024 and will result in a non-cash deferred tax charge of around $0.5 billion in the year ended 31 December 2025.
o 2023 and 2022 include a $146-million charge and a $505-million charge respectively for the EU Solidarity Contribution.

Liquidity and capital resources
Financial framework
The financial framework sets out how we allocate capital, balancing 
between strengthening the balance sheet, investing in the business, and 
delivering resilient distributions.
Net debt« at 31 December 2024 was $23.0 billion and is expected to 
reduce over time to a targeted range of $14-18 billion by the end of 2027, 
reflecting the allocation of potential proceeds from any transactions related 
to the Castrol strategic review and announcement to bring a strategic 
partner into Lightsource bp. The exact timing of achieving our net debt 
target range will therefore be impacted by the timing of any potential 
transactions. bp is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and ‘A’ 
range credit metrics throughout the cycle.
Our shareholder distributions include a dividend, resilient to a lower price 
environment, and we remain committed to sharing excess cash through 
share buybacks over time. Our distribution policy reflects the balance 
between the uses of cash alongside an ongoing consideration of factors, 
including changes in the environment, the underlying performance of the 
business, the outlook for the group financial framework, and other market 
factors which may vary quarter to quarter.
We expect operating cash flow to cover capital expenditure « and the 
dividend. Capital expenditure in 2024 was $16.2 billion, including $0.1 billion 
of inorganic capital expenditure «. We expect capital expenditure of around 
$15 billion in 2025 and a range of $13-15 billion per annum from 2026 to 
2027 including inorganic expenditure. This is a level that maximizes cash 
generation and grows the financial scale of the company. Within this frame 
we are reallocating capital to our highest returning opportunities, with an 
average $10 billion per year allocated to oil and gas, $3-4 billion in 
customers and products and less than $800 million per year in low carbon 
energy to 2027. In a period of low prices, the group has the flexibility to 
reduce or defer capital investment, as appropriate.
In 2024, the return on average capital employed « was 14.2%a at an average 
of $81 per barrel. The return on average capital employed is targeted to be 
over 16% by 2027 at $70 per barrel in 2024 real terms, and assuming bp 
planning assumptions, as we execute our reset strategy. This is supported 
by an expected compound annual growth rate in adjusted free cash flow « 
of over 20% from 2024 to 2027 and subject to the same price and planning 
assumptions.
a Nearest equivalent IFRS measures of numerator and denominator are profit for the year 
attributable to bp shareholders and total equity respectively: Profit for the year attributable to bp 
shareholders divided by total equity at the end of 2024 0.5%.
Dividends and other distributions to shareholders
The dividend is determined in US dollars, the economic currency of bp, and 
the dividend level is reviewed by the board each quarter. The quarterly 
dividend was increased from 7.270 to 8.000 cents per ordinary share per 
quarter in the second quarter of 2024.
The total dividend distributed to bp shareholders in 2024 was $5.0 billion 
(2023 $4.8 billion). This dividend was all paid in cash as shareholders no 
longer have the option to receive a scrip dividend in place of receiving cash.
Our dividend is resilient to a lower price environment. Based on our current 
forecasts and subject to the board’s discretion each quarter, we expect an 
annual increase in the dividend per ordinary share of at least 4%. 
Additionally, subject to board discretion, it is our intention to share excess 
cash with investors through share buybacks over time. This policy enables 
bp to share upside when the price environment is stronger, while ensuring 
the balance sheet remains resilient in a lower price environment. Taken 
together, our guidance is for total dividends and share buybacks to be in the 
range of 30 to 40% of operating cash flow over time, including buybacks to 
offset dilution from employee share schemes.
In 2024 bp executed $7.1 billion of share buybacks (2023 $7.9 billion), 
including fees and stamp duty. Since 1 January 2025 an additional 
$927 million shares have been repurchased up to 14 February 2025, 
including fees and stamp duty. 
In setting the dividend and share buybacks each quarter, the board will 
continue to take into account factors including the cumulative level of and outlook for  cash flow, share count reduction from buybacks and 
maintaining ‘A’ range credit metrics.
Financing the group’s activities
The group’s principal commodities, oil and gas, are priced internationally in 
US dollars. Group policy has generally been to minimize economic 
exposure to currency movements by financing operations with US dollar 
debt. Where debt and hybrid bonds are issued in other currencies, they are 
generally swapped back to US dollars using derivative contracts, or else 
hedged by maintaining offsetting cash positions in the same currency. 
Cash balances of the group are mainly held in US dollars or swapped to US 
dollars, and holdings are well diversified to reduce concentration risk. The 
group is not, therefore, exposed to significant currency risk regarding its 
cash or borrowings. Also see Risk factors on page 65 for further 
information on risks associated with prices and markets, and Financial 
statements – Note 29. 
The group’s finance debt at 31 December 2024 amounted to $59.5 billion 
(2023 $52.0 billion). Of the total finance debt, $4.5 billion is classified as 
short term at the end of 2024 (2023 $3.3 billion). See Financial statements 
– Note 26 for more information on the short-term balance. Net debt « was 
$23.0 billion at the end of 2024, an increase of $2.1 billion from the 2023 
year-end position of $20.9 billion. BP p.l.c. fully and unconditionally 
guarantees securities issued by BP Capital Markets p.l.c. and BP Capital 
Markets America Inc., which are 100%-owned finance subsidiaries of BP 
p.l.c.
At 31 December 2024 the group held a balance of $16.6 billion (2023 $13.6 
billion) issued perpetual subordinated hybrid instruments consisting of 
$14.6 billion (2023 $12.1 billion) hybrid bonds and $2.0 billion (2023 $1.5 
billion) hybrid securities. Proceeds from hybrid securities are typically 
earmarked to fund specific project or investment activities. As the group 
has the unconditional right to avoid transfer of cash or another financial 
asset in relation to these hybrid instruments, which were issued by group 
subsidiaries, they are classified as equity instruments and reported within 
non-controlling interest.
The ratio of finance debt to finance debt plus total equity at 31 December 
2024 was 43.2% (2023 37.8%). Gearing was 22.7% at the end of 2024 (2023 
19.7%). See Financial statements – Note 27 for finance debt, which is the 
nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis, and for further information 
on net debt.
Cash and cash equivalents of $39.2 billion at 31 December 2024 (2023 
$33.0 billion) are included in net debt. We manage our cash position so that 
the group has adequate cover to respond to potential short-term market 
liquidity, short-term price environment volatility, and expect to maintain a 
robust cash position.
The group also has an undrawn committed $8 billion credit facility and 
undrawn committed standby facilities of $4 billion (see Financial 
statements – Note 29 for more information). 
We believe that the group's resilient balance sheet and strong investment 
grade credit rating will allow the group to meet its known contractual and 
other obligations in both the short and long term with the group having 
sufficient working capital, taking into account the amounts of undrawn 
borrowing facilities, access to capital markets, levels of cash and cash 
equivalents and its ongoing ability to generate cash through operations. 
This belief is subject to a degree of uncertainty that can be expected to 
increase looking out over time and, accordingly, that future outcomes 
cannot be guaranteed or predicted with certainty.
bp utilizes various arrangements in order to manage its working capital 
including discounting of receivables and, in the supply and trading business, 
the active management of supplier payment terms, inventory and collateral.
Standard & Poor’s Ratings’ long-term credit rating for BP p.l.c. is A- (stable), 
the Moody’s Investors Service rating is A1 (stable) and the Fitch Ratings’ 
long-term credit rating is A+ (stable).
The group’s sources of funding, its access to capital markets and 
maintaining a strong cash position are described in Financial statements – 
Note 25 and Note 29. Further information on the management of liquidity 
risk and credit risk, and the maturity profile and fixed/floating rate 
characteristics of the group’s debt are also provided in Financial 
statements – Note 26 and Note 29.

Off-balance sheet arrangements
At 31 December 2024, the group’s share of third-party finance debt and 
lease liabilities of equity-accounted entities was $8.0 billion (2023 $9.9 
billion). These amounts are not reflected in the group’s debt on the balance 
sheet. The group has issued third-party guarantees under which amounts 
outstanding, incremental to amounts recognized on the balance sheet at 
31 December 2024, were $655 million (2023 $1,655 million) in respect of 
liabilities of joint ventures « and associates « and $585 million (2023 $598 
million) in respect of liabilities of other third parties. Of these amounts, $655 
million (2023 $1,609 million) of the joint ventures and associates 
guarantees relate to borrowings and, for other third-party guarantees, $430 
million (2023 $527 million) relate to guarantees of borrowings.

Commitments for the delivery of oil and gas
We sell crude oil, natural gas and liquefied natural gas under a variety of 
contractual obligations. Some of these contracts specify the delivery of 
fixed and determinable quantities. For the period from 2025 to 2027 
worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 444 
million barrels of oil, 6,277 billion cubic feet of natural gas, and 70Mt of 
liquefied natural gas. The commitments principally relate to group 
subsidiaries « based in Azerbaijan, Oman, Trinidad and Tobago, the UK and 
the US. We expect to fulfil these delivery commitments with production 
from our proved developed reserves and supplies from existing contracts, 
supplemented by market purchases as necessary.Additional disclosures

Oil and gas disclosures for the group
Analysis by region
Our oil and gas operations are set out below by geographical area, with 
associated significant events for 2024. bp’s percentage working interest in 
oil and gas assets is shown in brackets. Working interest is the cost-bearing 
ownership share of an oil or gas lease. Consequently, the percentages 
disclosed for certain agreements do not necessarily reflect the percentage 
interests in proved reserves, production or revenue. 
In addition to exploration, development and production activities, our oil 
production & operations (OP&O) and gas businesses also include certain 
midstream and liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply activities. Midstream 
activities involve the management of crude oil and natural gas pipelines, 
processing facilities and export terminals, LNG processing facilities and 
transportation, and our natural gas liquids (NGLs) processing business. 
Our upstream LNG activities are located in Abu Dhabi, Angola, Australia, 
Indonesia, Trinidad and from 2025, in Mauritania and Senegal. In 2024 our 
production was 11Mt of LNG from these assets, of which 4Mt were 
marketed through supply, trading and shipping (ST&S) , which supplements 
equity production with merchant third party volumes, leading to a global 
long-term strategic LNG portfolio of 23Mttpa. In addition to the long-term 
equity and merchant supply portfolio, bp has delivered 14Mtpa in 2024 of 
incremental merchant volumes through short and mid-term cargos 
managed through the ST&S LNG business. These supplement the long-
term portfolio and allow generation of short-term value when opportunities 
exist. 
The LNG is marketed through contractual rights to access import terminal 
capacity into the liquid gas markets of Europe, and the UK, and 
relationships to market directly to end-user customers or trading entities. 
LNG is supplied to all major LNG demand centres, for example Argentina, 
Brazil, the Caribbean, China, Croatia, the Mediterranean, Iberia and north-
west Europe, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, 
Türkiye and the UK.
Europe
bp has interest in offshore oil and gas activities in the UK and Norway. In 
2024 bp’s UK production came from two key areas: the Shetland area 
comprising the Clair and Schiehallion fields; and the central area 
comprising the Andrew area, Culzean, Vorlich and ETAP fields. In Norway, 
production was through our equity-accounted 15.9% interest in Aker BP.
•On 10 May bp was awarded a licence for two blocks in the central North 
Sea, consolidating our position around our Eastern Trough Area Project 
(ETAP) central processing facility. The award aligns with our strategic 
focus on oil and gas opportunities that can be developed through 
established production facilities.
•On 3 September Aker BP announced oil production had started from the 
Tyrving field in the Alvheim area (bp 15.9%). Tyrving is operated by Aker 
BP (61.26% working interest). The Tyrving development is part of the life 
extension of the Alvheim field and is expected to increase production 
while reducing both unit costs and emissions. Recoverable resources in 
Tyrving are approximately 25 million barrels of oil equivalent (gross).
•On 14 January 2025 Aker BP was awarded interests in 19 licences (of 
which it will operate 16) in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea (bp 15.9%).
•During the year an impairment charge of $1 billion was recognized in 
respect of certain assets in the North Sea as a result of changes to 
reserves and tax assumptions.
North America
Our oil and gas activities in North America are located in four areas: 
deepwater Gulf of America, the Lower 48 states, Canada and Mexico. 
bp has around 280 lease blocks in the Gulf of America and operates five 
production hubs.
•On 9 February the final investment decision was taken on the Atlantis 
Drill Center Expansion, which will be a two well tieback to the Atlantis 
facility in the Gulf of America (bp share 56%).
•On 30 July bp made the final investment decision on the Kaskida project 
in the deepwater Gulf of America. Kaskida will be bp's sixth hub in the 
Gulf of America and is expected to have a production capacity of 80,000 
barrels of crude oil per day (bp 100%). Following this decision, bp 
entered into agreements with Enbridge Offshore Facilities LLC to construct, own and operate oil and gas export pipelines to transport oil 
from Kaskida to the Green Canyon 19 platform and gas to markets in 
Louisiana. bp also entered into agreements with Shell Pipeline Company 
LP to transport oil from Green Canyon 19 to markets in Louisiana via a 
new build pipeline.
bpx energy, bp's onshore oil and gas business in the Lower 48 states, has 
significant operated and non-operated activities across Louisiana and 
Texas producing natural gas, oil, NGLs and condensate, with primary focus 
on developing unconventional resources. It had a 1.5 billion boe proved 
reserve base at 31 December 2024, predominantly in unconventional 
reservoirs (tight gas «, shale gas and shale oil). bpx energy's core assets 
span 0.8 million net developed acres with nearly 1,600 operated gross wells 
at 31 December 2024. Daily net production averaged 434mboe/d in 2024. 
bpx energy continues to operate as a separate business while remaining 
part of the OP&O segment. With its own governance, systems, and 
processes, it is structured to increase competitive performance through 
swift decision making and innovation, while maintaining bp’s commitment 
to safe, reliable and compliant operations.
•In April bpx energy successfully brought online 'Checkmate', its third 
central processing facility in the Permian Basin. It is a low-emission, 
electrified facility that will enable further production growth for bpx 
energy in the basin (bp 100% operator).
bp’s onshore US crude oil and product pipelines and related transportation 
assets were included in the customers & products segment in 2024.
In Canada, bp is focused on pursuing offshore exploration and 
development opportunities and conducts trading and marketing activities 
across various energy commodities. We hold exploration and significant 
discovery licences in offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, including an 
interest in the Equinor-operated Bay du Nord project. bp also holds offshore 
exploration licences in the Arctic, where the moratorium has been extended 
until 31 December 2028. 
In Mexico, bp held interests in an exploration block in the Salina Basin with 
Equinor and Total, Block 1 (bp 33% operator) and an exploration block in the 
Sureste Basin, Block 34 (bp 42.5% operator), with Total, QPI Mexico and 
Hokchi Energy. Hokchi Energy is a subsidiary of Pan American Energy 
Group (PAEG, see below) in which bp owns 50%. Separate to the above 
holdings in Mexico, Hokchi Energy also holds an interest in two other 
blocks.
•Formal relinquishment of Block 1 and Block 34 licences is still pending 
regulatory approval.
South America
bp has oil and gas activities in Argentina, Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago 
and, through PAEG, in Argentina and Bolivia. 
In Argentina, the bp and Total (operator) partnership on a 50:50 basis in two 
offshore exploration concessions has been relinquished as per regulatory 
approval received on 11 July.
In Brazil bp has interests in eight exploration areas across three basins:
•In April the appraisal plan for Alto de Cabo Frio Central block (bp 50%), in 
the southern portion of the Campos Basin, was approved by the 
regulator. 
•In May the Production Sharing Contract for the Tupinamba block, 
awarded to bp in 2023 during Brazil´s second Permanent Production 
Sharing Offer bid round was executed. bp holds 100% participation 
interest.
•In November bp, as operator in the BAR-M-346 block (bp 50%) filed a 
request to the regulatory authorities for exemption from the unfulfilled 
Minimum Work Program and Contract Termination due to delays in the 
environmental licensing process and is pending approval.
PAEG, a joint venture that is owned by bp (50%) and BC E&P Uruguay S.A. 
(50%), has activities mainly in Argentina and as noted above Mexico, and is 
also present in Bolivia. 
In Trinidad and Tobago bp holds interests in exploration and production 
licences and production-sharing contracts (PSCs) « covering 2.8 million 
acres offshore of the east and north-east coast. Facilities include 12 
offshore platforms, 2 subsea tiebacks and 2 onshore processing facilities. 
Production comprises gas and associated liquids. 
318 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

bp also holds interests in the Atlantic LNG facility. The total gross capacity 
of the LNG trains 2, 3 and 4 is approximately 12Mtpa. 
The Atlantic Train 1 plant has not been operational since 2020. The Atlantic 
shareholders, bp, Shell and the National Gas Company of Trinidad & 
Tobago (NGC), agreed to decouple the Train from the rest of the Atlantic 
facility with a view to decommissioning it. The Train has been made safe 
and decoupling and decommissioning work scopes are being planned. In 
2023 bp, Shell and NGC agreed to and executed the agreements for the 
restructuring of the ownership and commercial framework of the Atlantic 
LNG facility. The new ownership and commercial structure have been 
agreed for Trains 2 and 3 and took effect from 1 October 2024. Train 4 (T4) 
contracts expire on 1 May 2027, at which time, T4 will be rolled into the 
restructured arrangement. bp’s shareholding averages 43% across the two 
companies which own the LNG trains comprising the LNG facility.
•On 24 July bp and its partner the National Gas Company of Trinidad and 
Tobago Limited were awarded an exploration and production licence by 
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for the development of the Cocuina 
gas discovery. Cocuina is the Venezuelan portion of the cross-border 
Manakin-Cocuina gas field. bp is operator of the Manakin block which 
was discovered in 1998. Manakin declared commerciality in January 
2018; however, cross-border discussions had not progressed due to the 
impact of US sanctions. In October 2023 the US government eased 
sanctions on Venezuela’s oil sector for six months and further extended 
for two years until May 2026. The seismic acquisition programme over 
the joint Manakin-Cocuina field was successfully completed during 
September 2024.
•On 14 August bp announced it had agreed with EOG Resources Trinidad 
Limited (EOG) to partner on the Coconut gas development. bp approved 
the final investment decision for the project in June. Coconut is a 50/50 
joint venture with EOG as operator. The first gas is expected in 2027.
•On 2 September bp announced it has entered into an agreement with 
Perenco T&T to sell four mature offshore gas fields and associated 
production facilities in Trinidad & Tobago (Immortelle, Flamboyant, 
Amherstia and Cashima). The deal also included undeveloped resources 
from the Parang area and completed in December 2024.
•On 19 November bp entered into a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) 
with the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago for Block 
NCMA 2, located approximately 30 miles off Trinidad’s north coast. 
Seismic reprocessing activity is planned during 2025.
•Cypre, bp’s third subsea gas development in Trinidad and Tobago, 
started drilling in 2024 with first gas expected in 2025. The project is 
expected to have seven wells and be tied back to the Juniper platform.
•In September construction of the Ocelot project, which is a 6-inch liquids 
pipeline connecting Beachfield to terminal operations at Galeota Point, 
was completed.   
•The Mento (bp 50%/EOG 50% and operator) platform has sailed away, 
and installation was completed before the end of 2024. First gas is

In Azerbaijan, bp operates two PSAs, Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) (bp 
30.37%) and Shah Deniz (bp 29.99%) and also holds a number of other 
exploration leases. 
•On 16 April bp, as operator of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) field, 
announced the start-up of oil production from the new Azeri Central East 
(ACE) platform as part of the giant ACG field development, which is the 
first remotely operated offshore platform in the Caspian.
•On 4 June a new gas sales agreement (GSA) was signed with the 
Turkish state-owned company BOTAS covering the period 2025-2030. 
This is the fourth GSA between Shah Deniz and BOTAS since the start of 
production from the field in 2006.
•On 19 July bp and SOCAR signed a protocol to extend the Shafag-
Asiman exploration period until the end of June 2025 to allow for bp and 
SOCAR to continue discussions on the terms of any potential follow-on 
exploration activity.
•On 20 September the ACG joint venture partners announced the signing 
of an addendum to the existing PSA which enables the parties to 
progress the exploration, appraisal, development of and production from 
the non-associated natural gas reservoirs of the ACG field (bp operator 
with 30.37% equity).
•On 20 September bp and the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan 
Republic (SOCAR) signed a memorandum of understanding announcing 
the parties’ intention for bp to join SOCAR in two exploration and 
development blocks in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea. The 
first block is the Karabagh oil field, and the second block is the Ashrafi – 
Dan Ulduzu – Aypara area, containing a number of existing discoveries 
and prospective structures.
Naftiran Intertrade Co Ltd (NICO), a subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil 
Company, holds a 10% interest in the Shah Deniz joint venture. For 
information on the exclusion of this project from EU and US trade 
sanctions, see International trade sanctions on page 334.
bp holds a 30.1% interest in and operates the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil 
pipeline. The 1,768-kilometre pipeline transports oil from the ACG oilfield Additional disclosures

and condensate from the Shah Deniz gas and condensate field in the 
Caspian Sea, along with other third-party oil, to the eastern Mediterranean 
port of Ceyhan. The pipeline has a capacity of 1mmboe/d, with an average 
throughput in 2024 of 612mboe/d.
bp (as operator of Azerbaijan International Operating Company and the 
Georgian Pipeline Company for the Georgian section) also operates the 
Western Route Export Pipeline (WREP) that transports ACG oil to Supsa on 
the Black Sea coast of Georgia, with an average throughput of 2mboe/d in 
2024. Exports through the pipeline have been suspended since May 2022 
(with occasional short-term exports driven by operational needs) due to 
lack of nominations from the shipper group. In current market conditions 
WREP serves as a contingency export route for ACG crude product. 
bp holds a 29.99% interest in and operates certain parts of the 693-
kilometre South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP). The pipeline takes gas from the 
Shah Deniz field in Azerbaijan through Georgia to the Turkish border and 
has a capacity of 440mboe/d (including expansion), with average 
throughput in 2024 of 389mboe/d. 
bp also holds a 12% interest in the Trans Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline 
(TANAP). The pipeline takes Shah Deniz gas from the Turkish border and 
transports it to Eskisehir in Türkiye and to the Greek border where it 
connects with the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). The current capacity of 
TANAP is 275mboe/d and the average throughput in 2024 was 263mboe/d. 
bp has a 20% interest in TAP, which takes gas through Greece and Albania 
into Italy. The current capacity of TAP is 167mboe/d and the total average 
throughout in 2024 was 177mboe/d. TAP throughput exceeded capacity 
during 2024 due to high flow tests taking place during the year.
•On 16 September bp announced it had agreed for Apollo-managed 
funds to purchase a non-controlling stake in BP Pipelines TAP Limited, 
the bp subsidiary that holds a 20% share in TAP. bp remains the 
controlling shareholder of BP Pipelines TAP Limited.
In Oman, bp operates Block 61, the largest tight gas development in the 
Middle East (bp 40%). bp also has a 50% interest in Block 77 with Eni 
(operator) in which an exploration well was spudded in October 2023. 
Currently the prospect is under evaluation.
In Abu Dhabi, bp holds a 10% interest in the ADNOC Onshore concession. 
We also have a 10% equity shareholding in ADNOC LNG and a 10% 
shareholding in the shipping company NGSCO. ADNOC LNG supplied 
approximately 5.9Mt of LNG (0.8bcfe/d regasified) in 2024. bp’s interest in 
the ADNOC Onshore concession expires at the end of 2054.
•In July bp made the final investment decision to take a 10% interest in 
the planned 9.6mmtpa Ruwais LNG project, subject to receipt of 
appropriate merger clearances. 
In 2016 bp signed an enhanced technical service agreement for the 
duration of ten years for south and east Kuwait conventional oilfields, which 
includes the Burgan field, with Kuwait Oil Company. 
In India, we have a participating interest in two oil and gas PSAs (KG D6 
33.33% and NEC25 33.33%), and two oil and gas blocks under a revenue 
sharing contract (KG-UDWHP-2018/1 40% and KG-UDWHP-2022/1 40%), all 
operated by Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). We also have a 50% stake in 
India Gas Solutions Private Limited, a joint venture with RIL, for the sourcing 
and marketing of gas in India.
•In February 2025 bp and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited 
(ONGC) have signed agreement under which bp will serve as the 
technical services provider for ONGC’s Mumbai High field, India's largest 
oil and gas field. The scope of this bid award is to review the field 
performance and identify improvements in reservoir, facilities and wells 
to enhance production from the Mumbai High field over a 10-year 
contract period.
In the Asian part of Indonesia, bp holds an interest in the Andaman II PSC 
exploration block (operated by Harbour Energy), located offshore North 
Sumatra, and in Agung I and Agung II exploration blocks offshore 
Indonesia. Agung I covers over 6,000km2 off the coast of Bali and East Java 
and Agung II spans almost 8,000km2 offshore South Sulawesi, West Nusa 
Tenggara and East Java. 
In Iraq, bp holds a 49% participating interest in Basra Energy Company 
Limited (BECL). BECL is an incorporated joint venture (IJV) company owned by bp (49%) and PetroChina (51%) and acts as Rumaila lead contractor 
since 2022.
•On 25 February 2025 bp reached agreement on all contractual terms 
with the government of the Republic of Iraq to invest in several giant oil 
fields in Kirkuk providing for the rehabilitation and redevelopment of the 
fields, spanning oil, gas, power and water with potential for investment 
in exploration. The agreement is subject to final governmental 
ratification.
Australasia
bp has activities in Australia and Eastern Indonesia.
In Australia bp is one of six participants in the North West Shelf (NWS) 
venture, which has been producing LNG, pipeline gas, condensate, LPG and 
oil since the 1980s. Five partners hold interest in the gas infrastructure (bp 
16.67%) and six partners hold interest in the gas and condensate reserves 
(bp 15.78%). The NWS venture is one of the largest LNG export projects in 
the region, with five LNG trains in operation, and also supplies domestic gas 
into the Western Australia market. bp’s net share of the capacity of NWS 
LNG trains 1-5 is 2.67Mt (15.78% of 16.9mtpa gross) of LNG per year. This 
will be reduced in 2025 as one LNG train was taken offline in late 2024. bp 
is also one of four participants in the Browse LNG venture (bp 44.33%).
•In December Woodside and Chevron agreed to an asset swap under 
which Woodside will acquire Chevron’s interest in the North West Shelf 
(NWS) Project, the NWS Oil Project and the Angel Carbon Capture and 
Storage (CCS) Project. This will reduce the number of NWS venture 
partners to five upon expected completion in 2026.
bp also has a 50% interest in the WA-541 exploration title in Western 
Australia's offshore Northern Carnarvon basin. The joint venture, operated 
by Santos, is working towards the drilling of two commitment wells. 
In Papua Barat, Eastern Indonesia, bp operates the Tangguh LNG plant (bp 
40.22%). The plant consists of 3 trains with total production capacity of 
11.4Mtpa. The Tangguh asset comprises thirty production wells, four 
offshore platforms, three LNG processing trains, and two LNG loading 
facilities. Tangguh supplies LNG to customers in Indonesia, Mexico, China, 
South Korea, Taiwan and Japan through a combination of long, medium 
and spot contracts.
•On 21 November bp, on behalf of the Tangguh production sharing 
contract partners, announced a final investment decision on the $7 
billion Tangguh Ubadari, CCUS, Compression project (UCC), which has 
the potential to unlock around 3 trillion cubic feet of additional gas 
resources in Indonesia to help meet growing energy demand in Asia.
Oil and natural gas
Resource progression
bp manages its hydrocarbon resources in three major categories: prospect 
inventory, contingent resources and reserves. When a discovery is made, 
volumes usually transfer from the prospect inventory to the contingent 
resources category. The contingent resources move through various sub-
categories as their technical and commercial maturity increases through 
appraisal activity.
At the point of final investment decision, most proved reserves will be 
categorized as proved undeveloped (PUD). Volumes will subsequently be 
recategorized from PUD to proved developed (PD) as a consequence of 
development activity. When part of a well’s proved reserves depends on a 
later phase of activity, only that portion of proved reserves associated with 
existing, available facilities and infrastructure moves to PD. The first PD 
bookings will typically occur at the point of first oil or gas production. Major 
development projects typically take one to five years from the time of initial 
booking of PUD to the start of production. Changes to proved reserves 
bookings may be made due to analysis of new or existing data concerning 
production, reservoir performance, commercial factors and additional 
reservoir development activity.
Volumes can also be added or removed from our portfolio through 
acquisition or divestment of properties and projects. When we dispose of 
an interest in a property or project, the volumes associated with our 
adopted plan of development for which we have a final investment decision 
will be removed from our proved reserves upon completion of the 
transaction. When we acquire an interest in a property or project, the 
320 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

volumes associated with the existing development and any committed 
projects will be added to our proved reserves if bp has made a final 
investment decision and they satisfy the SEC’s criteria for attribution of 
proved status. Following the acquisition, additional volumes may be 
progressed to proved reserves from non-proved reserves or contingent 
resources.
Non-proved reserves and contingent resources in a field will only be 
recategorized as proved reserves when all the criteria for attribution of 
proved status have been met and the volumes are included in the business 
plan and scheduled for development, typically within five years. bp will only 
book proved reserves where development is scheduled to commence after 
more than five years if these proved reserves satisfy the SEC’s criteria for 
attribution of proved status and bp management has reasonable certainty 
that these proved reserves will be produced.
At the end of 2024 bp had no proved undeveloped reserves held for more 
than five years in our onshore US developments.
Over the past five years, bp has annually progressed a five-year average of 
19% (17% for 2023 five-year average) of our group proved undeveloped 
reserves (including the impact of disposals and price acceleration effects in 
PSAs) to proved developed reserves. This equates to a turnover time of five 
years. 
Proved reserves as estimated at the end of 2024 meet bp’s criteria for 
project sanctioning and SEC tests for proved reserves. We have not halted 
or changed our commitment to proceed with any material project to which 
proved undeveloped reserves have been attributed.
In 2024 we progressed 402mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves 
(325mmboe for our subsidiaries « alone) to proved developed reserves 
through ongoing investment in our subsidiaries’ and equity-accounted 
entities’ development activities. Total development expenditure, excluding 
midstream activities, was $11,541 million in 2024 ($7,953 million for 
subsidiaries and $3,588 million for equity-accounted entities). Of the $7,953 
million of total development expenditure for our subsidiaries, approximately 
$2,800 million was used for development activity to progress proved 
undeveloped reserves to proved developed. Of the $3,588 million 
development expenditure for our equity-accounted entities, approximately 
$1,100 million was used for development activity to progress proved 
undeveloped reserves to proved developed. The major areas with 
progressed volumes in 2024 were the US, Azerbaijan, Southern Cone and 
Middle East. 
Revisions of previous estimates for proved undeveloped reserves are due 
to changes relating to field performance, well results, revisions to future 
activity plans (including alignment with our investment criteria and changes 
to the macroeconomic climate) or changes in commercial conditions 
including price impacts. The net revisions to previous estimates across 
both our subsidiaries and our equity-accounted entities include net positive 
revisions driven by revisions to activity plans and revisions due to field 
performance, and net negative revisions driven by price and well results. 
The net revisions to previous estimates across only our subsidiaries include 
net positive revisions driven by revisions to activity plans and net negative 
revisions driven by price, field performance and well results. In each case, 
none of these factors resulted in revisions that were material to the group 
as a whole. The following tables describe the changes to our proved 
undeveloped reserves position through the year for our subsidiaries and 
equity-accounted entities, and for our subsidiaries alone.volumes in mmboea

bp bases its proved reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable 
certainty, with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on 
conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements. bp only applies 
technologies that have been field-tested and have been demonstrated to 
provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the 
formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. bp applies high-
resolution seismic data for the identification of reservoir extent and fluid 
contacts only where there is an overwhelming track record of success in its 
local application. In certain cases bp uses numerical simulation as part of a 
holistic assessment of recovery factor for its fields, where these 
simulations have been field-tested and have been demonstrated to provide 
reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the 
formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In certain 
deepwater fields bp has booked proved reserves before production flow 
tests are conducted, in part because of the significant safety, cost and 
environmental implications of conducting these tests. The industry has 
made substantial technological improvements in understanding, measuring 
and delineating reservoir properties without the need for flow tests. To 
determine reasonable certainty of commercial recovery, bp employs a 
general method of reserves assessment that relies on the integration of 
three types of data:
•Well data used to assess the local characteristics and conditions of 
reservoirs and fluids.
•Field-scale seismic data to allow the interpolation and extrapolation of 
these characteristics outside the immediate area of the local well 
control.
•Data from relevant analogous fields.
Well data includes appraisal wells or sidetrack holes, full logging suites, 
core data and fluid samples. bp considers the integration of this data in 
certain cases to be superior to a flow test in providing understanding of 
overall reservoir performance. The collection of data from logs, cores, Additional disclosures

wireline formation testers, pressures and fluid samples calibrated to each 
other and to the seismic data can allow reservoir properties to be 
determined over a greater volume than the localized volume of 
investigation associated with a short-term flow test. There is a strong track 
record of proved reserves recorded using these methods, validated by 
actual production levels.
Governance
bp’s centrally controlled process for proved reserves estimation approval 
forms part of a holistic and integrated system of internal control. It consists 
of the following elements:
•Accountabilities of certain officers of the group to ensure that there is 
review and approval of proved reserves bookings independent of the 
operating business, and that there are effective controls in the approval 
process and verification that the proved reserves estimates and the 
related financial impacts are reported in a timely manner.
•Capital allocation processes, whereby delegated authority is exercised 
to commit to capital projects that are consistent with the delivery of the 
group’s business plan. A formal review process exists to ensure that 
both technical and commercial criteria are met prior to the commitment 
of capital to projects.
•Internal audit, whose role is to consider whether the group’s system of 
internal control is adequately designed and operating effectively to 
respond appropriately to the risks that are significant to bp.
•Approval hierarchy, whereby proved reserves changes above certain 
threshold volumes require immediate review and all proved reserves 
require annual central authorization and have scheduled periodic 
reviews. The frequency of periodic reviews ensures that 100% of the bp 
proved reserves base undergoes central review every three years.
bp’s vice president of reserves is the individual primarily responsible for 
overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimate. He has more than 30 
years of diversified industry experience in reserves estimation with the past 
four years managing the governance and compliance. He is a past 
Chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (Russia & Caspian) and a 
member of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Expert 
Group on Resource Management.
No specific portion of compensation bonuses for senior management is 
directly related to proved reserves targets. Additions to proved reserves is 
one of several indicators by which the performance of the gas & low carbon 
and oil production & operations segments is assessed by the remuneration 
committee for the purposes of determining compensation bonuses for the 
executive directors. Other indicators include a number of financial and 
operational measures.
bp’s variable pay programme for the other senior managers in the gas & 
low carbon and oil production & operations segments is based on individual 
performance contracts. Individual performance contracts are based on 
agreed items from the business performance plan, one of which, if chosen, 
could relate to proved reserves.
Compliance
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) do not provide specific 
guidance on reserves disclosures. bp estimates proved reserves in 
accordance with SEC Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X and relevant 
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (C&DI) and Staff Accounting 
Bulletins as issued by the SEC staff.
By their nature, there is always risk involved in the ultimate development 
and production of proved reserves including, but not limited to: final 
regulatory approval; the installation of new or additional infrastructure, as 
well as changes in oil and gas prices; changes in operating and 
development costs; and the continued availability of additional 
development capital. All the group’s proved reserves held in subsidiaries 
and equity-accounted entities are estimated by the group’s petroleum 
engineers, or by independent petroleum engineering consulting firms and 
then assured by the group’s petroleum engineers.
Netherland, Sewell & Associates (NSAI), an independent petroleum 
engineering consulting firm, has estimated the net proved crude oil, 
condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas reserves, as of 
31 December 2024, of certain properties owned by bp in the US Lower 48. 
The properties evaluated by NSAI account for 100% of bp’s net proved 
reserves in the US Lower 48 as of 31 December 2024. The net proved 
reserves estimates prepared by NSAI were prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rule 4-10(a)(1)-(32) of Regulation S-X. All reserves 
estimates involve some degree of uncertainty. bp has filed NSAI’s 
independent report on its reserves estimates as an exhibit to this Annual 
Report and Form 20-F 2024 filed with the SEC.
Our proved reserves are associated with both concessions (tax and royalty 
arrangements) and agreements where the group is exposed to the 
upstream risks and rewards of ownership, but where our entitlement to the 
hydrocarbons is calculated using a more complex formula, such as with 
PSAs. In a concession, the consortium of which we are a part is entitled to 
the proved reserves that can be produced over the licence period, which 
may be the life of the field. In a PSA, we are entitled to recover volumes that 
equate to costs incurred to develop and produce the proved reserves, and 
an agreed share of the remaining volumes or the economic equivalent. As 
part of our entitlement is driven by the monetary amount of costs to be 
recovered, price fluctuations will have an impact on both production 
volumes and reserves.
We disclose our share of proved reserves held in equity-accounted entities 
(joint ventures « and associates «), although we do not control these 
entities or the assets held by such entities.
bp’s estimated net proved reserves and proved reserves

94% of our total proved reserves of subsidiaries at 31 December 2024 were 
held through joint operations « (94% in 2023), and 23% of the proved 
reserves were held through such joint operations where we were not the 
operator (25% in 2023).

Proved reserves replacement
Total hydrocarbon proved reserves at 31 December 2024, on an oil 
equivalent basis including equity-accounted entities, decreased by 8% 
compared with 31 December 2023 (8% decrease for subsidiaries and 4% 
decrease for equity-accounted entities). Natural gas decreased by 15% 
(19% decrease for subsidiaries and 5% increase for equity-accounted 
entities). 
There was a net decrease from acquisitions and disposals of 72mmboe 
within our US, Trinidad and North Africa subsidiaries.
The proved reserves replacement ratio « is the extent to which production 
is replaced by proved reserves additions. This ratio is expressed in oil 
equivalent terms and includes changes resulting from revisions to previous 
estimates, improved recovery, and extensions and discoveries. For 2024, 
the proved reserves replacement ratio excluding acquisitions and disposals 
was 50% (47% in 2023 and 20% in 2022) for subsidiaries and equity-
accounted entities, 52% for subsidiaries alone and 37% for equity-
accounted entities alone. There was a net decrease (96mmboe) of reserves 
due to lower gas and oil prices, primarily in our US subsidiaries, partly offset 
by an increase in reserves in some of our PSAs in Azerbaijan.
In 2024 net additions to the group’s proved reserves (excluding production, 
sales and purchases of reserves-in-place) amounted to 441mmboe 
(391mmboe for subsidiaries and 50mmboe for equity-accounted entities), 
through revisions to previous estimates including price, improved recovery 
from, and extensions to, existing fields, and discoveries of new fields. The 
majority of subsidiary additions were through revisions to previous 
estimates and extensions to existing fields and discoveries of new fields, 
where they represented a mixture of proved developed and proved 
undeveloped reserves. The principal proved reserves additions in our 
subsidiaries by region were in the US and the Middle East. The principal 
reserves additions in our equity-accounted entities were in PAEG.
In January 2024 it was reported that the Oslo District Court had determined 
that certain development permits granted by the Norwegian government 
during 2023 were invalid. This includes development permits for two fields 
in which Aker bp has an interest. The court’s decision is not final and could be appealed. If bp’s equity-accounted share of the reserves attributable to 
these two fields is removed from the calculation of bp’s 2024 proved 
reserves ratio, that ratio would remain the same. Removal of the same 
reserves from bp’s 2024 reporting would impact proved hydrocarbon 
reserves for the group, proved undeveloped reserves and estimated net 
proved reserves on an oil equivalent basis, amongst other reported 
measures, both for equity-accounted entities and group.
25% of our proved reserves are associated with PSAs. The countries in 
which we produced under PSAs in 2024 were Angola, Azerbaijan, Egypt, 
India, Indonesia, Mexico and Oman. In addition, the technical service 
contract (TSC) « governing our investment in the Rumaila field in Iraq 
functions as a PSA.
The group holds no licences in our PSAs or TSCs due to expire within the 
next three years that would have a significant impact on bp’s reserves or 
production, including undeveloped acreage.

Operating and capital expenditure on the prevention, control, treatment or 
elimination of air and water emissions and solid waste is often not incurred 
as a separately identifiable transaction. Instead, it forms part of a larger 
transaction that includes, for example, normal operations and maintenance 
expenditure. The figures for environmental operating and capital 
expenditure in the table are therefore estimates, based on the definitions 
and guidelines of the American Petroleum Institute.
Environmental operating expenditure of $575 million in 2024 (2023 $524 
million) showed an overall increase of 10%, largely due to increased 
expenditure in BP Products North America.
Environmental capital expenditure of $393 million in 2024 (2023 $329 
million) showed an overall increase of 19%, largely due to increased 
expenditure for BP Products North America.
Clean-up costs were $20 million in 2024 (2023 $23 million), representing oil 
spill clean-up costs and other associated remediation and disposal costs. 
In addition to operating and capital expenditure, we also establish 
provisions for future environmental remediation work. Expenditure against 
such provisions normally occurs in subsequent periods and is not included 
in environmental operating expenditure reported for such periods.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is 
probable and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. 
Generally, this coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, 
if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.
The extent and cost of future environmental restoration, remediation and 
abatement programmes are inherently difficult to estimate. They often 
depend on the extent of contamination, and the associated impact and 
timing of the corrective actions required, technological feasibility and bp’s 
share of liability. Though the costs of future programmes could be 
significant and may be material to the results of operations in the period in 
which they are recognized, it is not expected that such costs will be 
material to the group’s overall results of operations or financial position. For 
further information, see Note 1 - Significant judgements and estimates: 
provisions.
Additions to our environmental remediation provision reflect new liabilities 
and scope/cost reassessments of the remediation plans of a number of 
our sites, primarily in the US. The charge for environmental remediation 
provisions in 2024 arising from new and acquired sites was $24 million 
(2023 $37 million and 2022 $67 million).
In addition, we make provisions on installation of our oil and gas producing 
assets and related pipelines to meet the cost of eventual decommissioning. 
On installation of an oil or natural gas production facility, a provision is 
established that represents the discounted value of the expected future 
cost of decommissioning the asset.
In 2024, the net increase in the decommissioning provision was primarily 
due to recognition of additional provisions and changes in cost estimate 
assumptions.
We undertake periodic reviews of existing provisions. These reviews take 
account of revised cost assumptions, changes in decommissioning 
requirements and any technological developments.
Provisions for environmental remediation and decommissioning are usually 
established on a discounted basis, as required by IAS 37 ‘Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’.
Further details of decommissioning and environmental provisions appear in 
Financial statements – Note 23.Regulation of the group’s business
Our businesses and operations are subject to the laws and regulations 
applicable in each country, state or other regional or local area in which they 
occur. These cover virtually all aspects of bp’s activities and include 
matters such as the acquisition of rights to develop and operate projects, 
production rates, royalties, environmental, health and safety protection, fuel 
specifications and transportation, trading, pricing, anti-trust, export, taxes, 
and foreign exchange.
Oil and gas contractual and regulatory framework
The terms and conditions of the leases, licences and contracts under which 
our upstream oil and gas interests are held vary from country to country. 
These leases, licences and contracts are generally granted by or entered 
into with a government entity or state-owned or controlled company and 
are sometimes entered into with private property owners. Arrangements 
with governmental or state entities usually take the form of licences or 
production-sharing agreements « (PSAs), although arrangements with 
private entities and US government entities are usually by lease.
Licences (or concessions) give the holder the right to explore for, develop 
and produce a commercial discovery. Under a licence, the holder bears the 
risk of exploration, development and production activities and provides the 
financing for these operations. In principle, the licence holder is entitled to 
all production, minus any royalties that are payable in kind. A licence holder 
is generally required to pay production taxes or royalties, which may be in 
cash or in kind.
In certain countries, separate licences are required for exploration and 
production activities, and in some cases production licences are limited to 
only a portion of the area covered by the original exploration licence.
PSAs entered into with a government entity or state-owned or state-
controlled company generally require bp (alone or with other contracting 
companies) to provide all the financing and bear the risk of exploration and 
production activities in exchange for a share of the production remaining 
after royalties, if any. Less typically, bp may explore for, develop and 
produce hydrocarbons under a service agreement with the host entity in 
exchange for reimbursement of costs and/or a fee paid in cash rather than 
production.
bp frequently conducts its exploration and production activities in joint 
arrangements or co-ownership arrangements with other international oil 
companies, state-owned or -controlled companies and/or private 
companies. Conventionally, all costs, benefits, rights, obligations, liabilities 
and risks incurred in carrying out joint arrangement or co-ownership 
operations under a lease, licence or PSA are shared among the joint 
arrangement or co-owning parties according to agreed ownership interests 
which are set out in a joint operating agreement. To the extent that any 
liabilities arise, whether to governments or third parties, or between the joint 
arrangement parties or co-owners themselves, each joint arrangement 
party or co-owner will generally be liable under the terms of a joint 
operating agreement to meet these in proportion to its ownership interest. 
Any agreed allocation of liability amongst the joint arrangement parties is, 
however, often different to the position under the relevant licence, lease or 
PSA, which may provide for joint and several liability of the joint 
arrangement parties including for decommissioning obligations. In many 
upstream operations, a party (known as the operator) will be appointed 
(pursuant to a joint operating agreement) to carry out day to-day operations 
on behalf of the joint arrangement or co-ownership. The operator is 
typically one of the joint arrangement parties or a co-owner and will carry 
out its duties either through its own staff, or by contracting out various 
elements to third-party contractors or service providers. bp acts as operator 
on behalf of joint arrangements and co-ownerships in a number of 
countries.
Frequently, work (including drilling and related activities) will be contracted 
out to third-party service providers. The relevant contract will specify the 
work, the remuneration, and typically the risk allocation between the parties. 
Depending on the service to be provided, the contract may also contain 
provisions allocating risks and liabilities associated with pollution and 
environmental damage, damage to a well or hydrocarbon reservoirs and for 
claims from third parties or other losses. The allocation of those risks Additional disclosures
« See glossary on page 351 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 329

varies among contracts and is determined through negotiation between the 
parties.
In general, bp incurs income tax on income generated from production 
activities (whether under a licence or PSA). In addition, depending on the 
area, bp’s production activities may be subject to a range of other taxes, 
levies and assessments, including special petroleum taxes and revenue 
taxes. The taxes imposed on oil and gas production profits and activities 
may be substantially higher than those imposed on other activities, for 
example in Egypt, the UK, the US and the United Arab Emirates.
Low carbon energy – renewables contractual and 
regulatory framework
The majority of our renewable assets are held indirectly through interests in 
incorporated joint ventures or special purpose entities (in either case, a 
Project Company). The renewables contractual and regulatory framework 
and the rights granted in relation to a renewable asset significantly vary 
from country to country. In some countries, the regulatory framework is still 
under development or subject to significant change as the renewables 
industry evolves.
In general terms the rights to a renewable asset are usually held by a 
Project Company through a package of assets that together form the 
renewable project owned by such Project Company, including:
•one or more leases, easements or licences over land or seabed granted 
by a public or private individual or entity that grant the Project Company 
rights to develop, build and operate the renewable asset in such areas of 
land or seabed;
•one or more generation licences that grant the Project Company the 
right to produce and sell the electricity to the market;
•an interconnection agreement that grants the Project Company the right 
to connect the power project into the grid;
•an offtake agreement which, depending on the country’s electricity 
market, is entered into with a utility company, a corporate buyer or a 
public entity; and
•potentially, a subsidy mechanism in the form of a feed in tariff, contract 
for difference, hedging mechanism or renewable energy certificate to 
support the development of the project.
The risk allocation between the developer/generator and the host 
government or private entity has not been standardized in the industry. 
However, in general terms the Project Company bears the risk of the 
development, construction and operation of the renewable energy project 
and secures the financing for these operations and receives any profit from 
the revenue generated through the offtake agreement and/or subsidy 
mechanism (if available).
Greenhouse gas regulation
In December 2015, nearly 200 nations at the United Nations climate change 
conference in Paris (COP21) agreed to the Paris Agreement which aims to 
hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C 
above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature 
increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Signatories aim to reach 
global peaking of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as soon as possible 
and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter, so as to achieve a balance 
between human caused emissions and removals by sinks of GHGs in the 
second half of this century. The Paris Agreement commits all signatories to 
submit Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) (i.e. pledges or plans of 
climate action) and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the 
objectives of their NDCs. Signatories are required to submit revised NDCs 
every five years, and the revised NDCs are expected to be more ambitious 
with each revision. The first global stocktake of progress was published by 
the United Nations in September 2023 and further assessments will occur 
every five years. The UAE conference (COP28) in Dubai, which took place in 
November and December 2023, marked the conclusion and outcome of 
this first stocktake and reached a ‘consensus’ which includes calls for an 
acceleration of efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power 
and to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. The 2024 Baku 
conference (COP 29) included agreements in relation to finance and carbon 
markets. 
More stringent national and regional measures relating to the transition to a 
lower carbon economy, such as the UK's 2050 net zero carbon emissions 
commitment, can be expected in the future. These measures could increase bp’s production costs for certain products, increase compliance 
and litigation costs, increase demand for competing energy alternatives or 
products with lower-carbon intensity, and affect the sales and 
specifications of many of bp’s products. Further, such measures could lead 
to constraints on production and supply and access to new reserves, 
particularly due to the long-term nature of many of bp’s projects.
Certain current and announced GHG measures and developments 
potentially affecting bp’s businesses in various markets in which bp 
operates are summarized below. For information on steps that bp is taking 
in relation to climate change issues and for details of bp’s GHG reporting, 
see Sustainability – Net zero aims on page 48.
United States
In the US, bp's operations are affected by the regulation of GHGs in a 
number of ways. The federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and its various 
amendments regulate air emissions, permitting, fuel specifications and 
other aspects of our production, refining, distribution and marketing 
activities.
GHG Reporting Rule
The federal GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule requires operators of certain 
facilities and producers and importers/exporters of petroleum products to 
file annual GHG emissions reports with EPA quantifying direct GHG 
emissions from affected facilities, as well as the GHG emissions that would 
result from the release or combustion of the petroleum products imported, 
exported or produced. In addition, several states have their own GHG 
reporting rules.
Our US businesses are subject to increased GHG and other environmental 
requirements and regulatory uncertainty, including that the current or any 
future US administration could revise or revoke current or prior 
administration programmes, as well as the possibility of increased 
expenditures in having to comply with numerous diverse and non-uniform 
regulatory initiatives at the state and local levels.
US Inflation Reduction Act
The 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) included a significant package of 
largely supply-side measures supporting low carbon energy sources and 
decarbonization technologies in the US. The impact of the IRA both on bp’s 
businesses and more widely on the US economy is likely to depend on 
various factors that are currently uncertain, including the implementation of 
the incentive programmes by the US authorities through the Department of 
Energy (DOE), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and other 
agencies, as well as regulatory initiatives at the federal, state and local 
levels.
In 2023, bp applied for various DOE and FAA grants related to certain of 
bp’s low carbon energy and decarbonization projects. In 2024, DOE and 
FAA notified bp of its grant awards; bp and its co-applicants executed 
award agreements with the DOE, and bp is currently working with FAA on 
its award agreement. Regulatory uncertainty due to a change in U.S. 
administrations may significantly affect the implementation of IRA 
programmes.
Methane
In November 2023, the EPA promulgated the “Standards of Performance 
for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines 
for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review.” These 
regulations are focused on methane emissions from oil and gas production 
at new and existing facilities and include significant requirements in the 
areas of fugitive emissions monitoring and repair, flaring, emission event 
reporting, process controller and pump emissions, and storage vessels.
The IRA requires EPA to collect an annual Waste Emissions Charge (WEC) 
on methane emissions from oil and natural gas facilities that exceed 
specific levels of emissions and methane intensity. The WEC is $900/
metric ton of methane emissions occurring in 2024, $1,200/metric ton for 
emissions occurring in 2025, and $1,500/metric ton for emissions 
occurring in 2026 and thereafter. In November 2024, EPA promulgated 
regulations to implement the WEC provisions of the IRA. 
Climate Resilience Funds
Several U.S. states, including New York, New Jersey and Vermont have 
enacted laws seeking recovery from historical greenhouse gas emitters to 
330 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

create climate resilience funds to address climate change impacts by 
financing infrastructure upgrades, disaster preparation, and other resilience 
projects. Other states, including California, Maryland and Massachusetts, 
are considering similar legislation. The extent and cost of to us of such 
future environmental climate fund programmes are difficult to estimate at 
this time.
Electricity
Other EPA GHG and environmental regulations affect electricity generation 
practices and prices and have an impact on the market for fuels used to 
generate electricity and on renewable energy installations. These 
regulations are in flux due to changes in approach between presidential 
administrations, as well as lawsuits challenging those regulations.
The 2022 Supreme Court decision in West Virginia v. EPA limited EPA’s 
regulatory authority to require electricity 'generation shifting' (e.g. from coal 
to natural gas or renewable sources). In response to the West Virginia v. 
EPA decision, in April 2024 EPA promulgated  new carbon pollution 
standards for coal and gas-fired power plants. The  regulations significantly  
tighten emissions limits for those plants and will require some plants to 
install carbon capture technology. 
Renewable Fuel Standard
EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) regulations require transportation 
fuel sold in the US to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. In 
2023, EPA announced a final rule establishing biofuel volume requirements 
and associated percentage standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based 
diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel for 2023-2025. Lawsuits 
were filed challenging this final rule and are ongoing.
State Low Carbon Fuel Standards
A number of states, municipalities and regional organizations continue to 
advance climate initiatives that affect our US operations. For example, 
certain state initiatives impose carbon-intensity reduction requirements on 
transportation fuels sold in those states. In November 2024, California 
updated  its Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) to achieve a 30% reduction 
in carbon intensity by 2030 and a 90% reduction in carbon intensity by 
2045. In 2021, Washington enacted state-wide carbon cap and invest 
legislation and a Clean Fuels Program (similar to California’s LCFS) and 
finalized regulations implementing both of those programmes in 2022.
Mobile Source Emissions
US fuel markets are affected by EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) regulation of light, medium and heavy-duty vehicle 
emissions (both fuel economy and tailpipe standards) as well as for non-
road engines and vehicles and certain large GHG stationary emission 
sources.
Light-duty and Medium Duty Vehicles
In March 2024, EPA promulgated a final rule entitled “Multi-Pollutant 
Emissions Standards for Model Year 2027 and Later Light-Duty and 
Medium-Duty Vehicles,” which significantly tightens emissions standards 
for light- and medium-duty vehicles for model year (MY) 2027 and beyond 
and imposes new warranty, durability, and certification requirements, 
including for electric vehicles. The regulations are intended to spur 
emissions reductions technology on hydrocarbon-powered vehicles and to 
encourage the transition to electric vehicles. The regulations will phase in 
over MY 2027-2032.  
Heavy-Duty Vehicles
In 2022, EPA promulgated a final rule entitled “Control of Air Pollution from 
New Motor Vehicles: Heavy Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards,” which 
established new emission standards for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other 
pollutants for highway heavy-duty engines.
California Mobile Sources
The CAA authorizes the state of California to set its own separate vehicle 
emissions regulations, stricter than those at the federal level. Under CAA 
Section 209, California can apply to EPA for a waiver of federal pre-emption, 
and EPA is to grant this waiver absent certain disqualifying conditions. 
Under CAA Section 177, other states can adopt California standards or 
follow federal standards but cannot set their own. In 2020, California 
entered into voluntary framework agreements with several carmakers to meet more demanding vehicle emissions standards in California through 
MY 2026.
California Advanced Clean Cars Program
California’s Advanced Clean Cars (ACC) regulations were originally enacted 
in 2012 for MY 2015 to 2025. The ACC program is a package of state 
regulations that set emissions standards for criteria pollutants, GHG 
emission standards for light-duty vehicles, and a ZEV sales mandate. In 
2019, EPA and NTSA jointly promulgated the “Safer Affordable Fuel-
Efficient Vehicles Rule Part One: One National Program (SAFE-1),” which 
effectively disallowed the ACC program. In 2021, EPA revoked SAFE-1, and 
the ACC program went back into force. In response to a legal challenge, the 
U.S. Court of Appeals upheld EPA’s decision to restore the California waiver, 
although that court ruling has been appealed to the United States Supreme 
Court and is pending.
In 2022, California finalized the next generation of its GHG and ZEV 
standards (referred to as 'ACC II'). The ACC II sets annual ZEV and plug-in 
hybrid vehicle (PHEV) sales requirements from MY 2026 to 2035 and 
increasingly more stringent emission standards to ensure automakers 
gradually phase out new sales of internal combustion engine vehicles.
In 2023, California filed a CAA Section 209 waiver of federal pre-emption 
application with EPA. In December 2024, EPA granted California’s waiver 
under ACC II that requires that by MY 2035, all new light-duty vehicles sold 
in California must be ZEVs or PHEVs. These regulations may impact bp’s 
product mix and demand for particular products. 
California Advanced Clean Trucks Program
In 2023, EPA granted California’s request for a waiver of federal preemption 
covering, in part, its Advanced Clean Trucks Program, which mandates 
increasing quantities of ZEV sales for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles in 
the state. Legal challenges to that decision have been filed and are pending.
These and other initiatives to reduce GHG emissions may have a significant 
effect on the production, sale and profitability of many of bp’s products in 
the US.
European Union 
The EU has adopted a goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 as part 
of the European Green Deal and, subsequently, a 55% GHG reduction target 
by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. To achieve this target, EU member states 
and Parliament adopted most measures proposed as part of the so-called 
‘Fit for 55’ package. These include: revisions of the EU Emissions Trading 
Scheme (EU ETS) and a newly created Carbon Border Adjustment 
Mechanism (CBAM); the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) – including an 
obligation on transport fuel suppliers to increase the share of renewables of 
their fuel supply; a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending mandate from 
2025; and CO 2 targets for the sales of new vehicles which are expected to 
accelerate the decarbonization of the transport sector and impact fuel 
demand.
Once fully adopted and implemented, this would inter alia lead to higher 
shares of renewables across all sectors (including transport), a reduced 
number of GHG emission allowances under the EU ETS, and a target of 
zero gramme of CO 2 per km for new passenger cars by 2035. The EU also 
adopted measures to reduce methane emissions.
Some EU member states have adopted national targets above and beyond 
current EU climate goals, such as Germany, with a climate neutrality target 
by 2045.
United Kingdom
In November 2024, the UK government announced a nationally determined 
contribution target to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions by at least 81% 
by 2035 compared to 1990 levels.
The UK Emissions Trading System (UK ETS) launched on 1 January 2021 
following the end of the Brexit transition period and the UK’s participation in 
the EU ETS. It seeks to provide a carbon pricing mechanism as a tool for 
helping achieve the UK's net zero target and covers the same GHGs and 
sectors as the EU ETS. bp’s North Sea operations are subject to the UK 
ETS.
In July 2023, the UK government published a response to a 2022 
consultation on proposed changes to the UK ETS rules. That response 
included decisions to expand the scope of the scheme to include domestic Additional disclosures
« See glossary on page 351 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 331

maritime transport from 2026, waste incineration and energy from waste 
from 2028 and process emissions from carbon dioxide venting from the 
upstream oil and gas sector from 2025.
In December 2023, the UK ETS Authority published two consultations. One 
covers a review of the UK ETS markets policy and the other relates to a 
review of free allocation methodology for the stationary sectors under the 
UK ETS to better target those most at risk of carbon leakage.
Other countries and regions
China is operating emissions trading pilot programmes in a number of 
cities and provinces. One of bp's subsidiaries in China is participating in 
these programmes. In February 2021 China introduced a national 
emissions trading market (National ETS). The National ETS is intended to 
be an essential tool for China to fulfil its commitment to reach peak 
emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. For now, the National 
ETS participants are limited to the key emission entities identified by each 
provincial-level government authority and approved by the Ministry for 
Ecology and Environment of China. bp is not participating in the National 
ETS. On 9 September 2024, the Ministry for Ecology and Environment of 
China released a draft work plan to expand the sectoral coverage of the 
National ETS. Currently covering only the power sector, the plan proposes 
to extend the National ETS to include the cement, steel, and aluminium 
industries.
In October 2021, as part of its ‘1+N’ climate policy framework, China issued 
working guidance setting out specific targets and measures for achieving 
peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality, and an action plan which sets 
out the main objectives for the next decade to achieve peak carbon 
emissions by 2030. The working guidance is the '1' (i.e. a long-term 
approach to combating climate change), while 'N' are various policies 
starting with the action plan. In June 2022, 17 government authorities 
jointly released the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy 2035 
making overall plans to prepare the country to adapt to climate change 
from the present to 2035.
China's domestic voluntary carbon mechanism called the China Certified 
Emission Reduction (CCER) programme has been suspended since 2017. 
In 2023, significant progress towards relaunching the CCER has been made 
by relevant authorities, including the promulgation of a regulation on CCER 
trading for trial implementation and the publication of methodologies that 
will be used to quantify net emission reductions or removals for four types 
of projects (forestation, solar thermal power, offshore wind power 
generation and mangrove revegetation). CCER programme was relaunched 
on 22 January 2024 and the first CCER project after the relaunch was 
registered on 3 December 2024. On 3 January 2025, two new CCER 
methodologies were released – for issuing carbon credits to projects 
utilizing coal mine gas and energy efficient highway tunnel lighting.
On 5 January 2024, China’s State Council approved an interim regulation for 
the national emissions trading scheme. The final version was issued on 4 
February 2024 which has provisions on defining the scale of the national 
carbon market, determining allocation of emissions allowances and data 
quality supervision.
Other environmental regulation
In addition to the GHG regulations referred to above, climate change 
programmes and regulation of unconventional oil and gas extraction under 
a number of environmental laws may have a significant effect on the 
production, sale and profitability of many of bp’s products.
Environmental laws also require bp to remediate and restore areas affected 
by the release of hazardous substances or hydrocarbons associated with 
our operations or properties. These laws may apply to sites that bp 
currently owns or operates, sites that it previously owned or operated, or 
sites used for the disposal of its and other parties’ waste. See Financial 
statements – Note 23 for information on provisions for environmental 
restoration and remediation.
A number of pending or anticipated governmental proceedings against 
certain bp group companies under environmental laws could result in 
monetary or other sanctions. Group companies are also subject to 
environmental claims for personal injury and property damage alleging the 
release of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The costs associated 
with future environmental remediation obligations, governmental 
proceedings and claims could be significant and may be material to the results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. We cannot 
accurately predict the effects of future developments, such as stricter 
environmental laws and regulations or enforcement policies, or future 
events at our facilities on the group, and there can be no assurance that 
material liabilities and costs will not be incurred in the future. For a 
discussion of the group’s environmental expenditure, see page 329 and for 
a discussion of legal proceedings, see page 218.
Significant health, safety and environmental legislation and regulation 
affecting our businesses and profitability, in addition to those referred to 
above, include the following:
United States
•The Clean Water Act regulates wastewater and other effluent 
discharges from bp’s facilities, and bp is required to obtain discharge 
permits, install control equipment and implement operational controls 
and preventative measures.
•The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulates the 
generation, storage, transportation and disposal of wastes associated 
with our operations and can require corrective action at locations where 
such wastes have been disposed of or released. bp has incurred, or is 
likely to incur, liability under RCRA or similar state laws in connection 
with sites bp operates or previously operated.
•The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
Liability Act (CERCLA) can, in certain circumstances, impose the entire 
cost of investigation and remediation on a party who owned or operated 
a site contaminated with a hazardous substance, or who arranged for 
disposal of a hazardous substance at a site. bp has incurred, or is likely 
to incur, liability under CERCLA or similar state laws, including costs 
attributed to insolvent or unidentified parties. bp is also subject to 
claims for remediation costs and natural resource damages under 
CERCLA and other federal and state laws. CERCLA also requires 
reporting on the releases of certain quantities of listed hazardous 
substances to designated government agencies. In April 2024, EPA 
listed PFOA and PFOS (types of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) used 
in fire-fighting foam and many consumer products ) as hazardous 
substances under CERCLA. This listing may impact remediation costs 
and result in additional reporting and other environmental obligations. 
Several states have passed legislation limiting the use of PFAS in fire-
fighting foam, and other states may do so in the future.
•The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act requires 
reporting on the storage, use and releases of certain quantities of listed 
extremely hazardous substances to designated government agencies.
•The Toxic Substances Control Act regulates bp’s manufacture, import, 
export, sale and use of chemical substances and products. In addition, 
EPA has revised processes and procedures for prioritization of existing 
chemicals for risk evaluation, assessment and management. Agency 
actions and announcements are monitored regularly to identify 
developments with potential impacts on chemical substances important 
to bp products and operations.
•The Occupational Safety and Health Act imposes workplace safety and 
health requirements on bp operations along with significant process 
safety management obligations, requiring continuous evaluation and 
improvement of operational practices to enhance safety and reduce 
workplace emissions at gas processing, refining and other regulated 
facilities.
•The Oil Pollution Act 1990 imposes operational requirements, liability 
standards and other obligations governing the transportation of 
petroleum products in US waters. States may impose additional 
obligations. Alaska, West Coast and certain East Coast states impose 
additional requirements and stricter liability standards.
•The Outer Continental Shelf Land Act, the Mineral Leasing Act and other 
statutes give the Department of Interior (DOI) and the Bureau of Land 
Management authority to regulate operations and air emissions, 
including equipment and testing, at offshore and onshore operations on 
federal lands subject to DOI authority.
•The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Marine Mammal Protection Act 
protect certain species’ habitats from adverse human impacts by 
restricting operations or development at certain times and in certain 
places. In 2020, the US Fish and Wildlife Service published regulatory 
definitions impacting habitat designations under the ESA, but in 2022 
the Biden administration rescinded those definitions. The Biden 
administration rescission of those definitions could expand the 
geographic areas subject to habitat protections.

European Union
•The Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) 2010 provides the framework 
for granting permits for major industrial sites. A recently agreed revision 
of the IED could, once formally adopted and implemented, potentially set 
more stringent permitting requirements, and lead to a further tightening 
of emission limit values. 
•The EU Registration, Evaluation Authorization and Restriction of 
Chemicals (REACH) Regulation 2006 requires registration of chemical 
substances manufactured in or imported into the EU, together with the 
submission of relevant hazard and risk data. REACH affects our 
manufacturing or trading/import operations in the EU. bp maintains 
compliance by checking whether imports are covered by the 
registrations of non-EU suppliers’ representatives, preparing and 
submitting registration dossiers to cover new manufactured and 
imported substances, and updating previously submitted registrations 
as required. 
•The Water Framework Directive (WFD) published in 2000 aims to 
protect the quantity and quality of ground and surface waters of the EU 
member states. The implementation in the EU member states is still 
ongoing, planned to be finalised by 2027. Future proceedings on the 
determination of pollutants/priority substances as well as 
environmental quality standards in line with the WFD may require 
additional compliance efforts and increased costs for managing 
freshwater withdrawals and discharges from bp’s EU operations.
•The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) entered into 
force on 5 January 2023 introducing new requirements for certain EU 
and non-EU companies, to include disclosures related to climate, the 
environment and wider sustainability issues. The CSRD also expands to 
in-scope entities the requirements introduced by the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation, to identify environmentally sustainable activities and then 
disclose metrics related to capital and operating expenditure and 
turnover associated with those activities. Disclosure requirements will 
be phased in from 2025, in respect of the 2024 financial year.
•The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) entered 
into force in July 2024 and requires certain EU and non-EU companies 
to conduct due diligence on human rights and environmental risks, 
adopt a transition plan aligned with the Paris Agreement, and comply 
with enforcement by EU authorities from July 2027.
United Kingdom
•Following the UK’s exit from the European Union, operative EU laws 
were retained in UK law by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 
(EUWA). In June 2023, the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) 
Act 2023 received Royal Assent. That Act allows for significant changes 
to the status, operation and content of retained EU law, including 
through amendments to the EUWA. This may mean that over time there 
will be amendments to and deviations from retained EU law including in 
respect of environmental matters.
•Since the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, there has 
been a parallel UK REACH regime which applies in Great Britain only, 
with EU REACH continuing to apply in Northern Ireland. UK REACH 
contains equivalent requirements to EU REACH, although future 
developments and potential divergences are uncertain. 
•The Environment Act 2021 comprises various key parts including 
governance, waste and resource efficiency, air quality and 
environmental recall, water, nature and biodiversity and conservation 
covenants. The governance parts include a comprehensive framework 
for legally binding environmental improvement targets; to establish a 
framework for future policy statements on environmental principles to 
protect the environment by making environmental considerations a key 
part of policy development process across government; and to establish 
the Office for Environmental Protection, an independent public body to 
have oversight of environmental matters. The UK government’s first 
suite of environmental targets became law in January 2023, but these 
have not had a material impact on bp. 
Other countries and regions
Regulations governing the discharge of treated water have also been 
developed in countries outside the US and EU including in Trinidad where 
bp commissioned a new wastewater treatment plant in 2020 to meet 
consent levels agreed with the regulators to apply relevant water discharge 
rules. The Abidjan Convention, along with the Additional Protocol published in 
2012, sets environmental quality standards for the discharge of chemicals 
to the marine environment. Mauritania and Senegal are both signatories to 
the Abidjan Convention. bp is currently constructing the offshore facilities 
to include produced water management systems to meet the 
environmental quality standards for our future gas operations in Mauritania 
and Senegal.
The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-
East Atlantic (OSPAR), aims to protect the marine environment of the 
North-East Atlantic. The OSPAR 2012 recommendation and guideline for 
the implementation of a risk-based approach to the management of 
produced water discharges from offshore installations in the North Sea 
supports a key goal of working towards eliminating harmful discharges. In 
2020 the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers issued a report 
'Oil And Gas Risk Based Assessment of Offshore Produced Water 
Discharges' which presents industry good practice and aims to broaden the 
understanding and acceptance of Risk Based Assessment (RBA) 
techniques internationally and improve consistency in the application of 
assumptions, levels of conservatism, and selection of risk endpoints.
At OSPAR’s Offshore Industry Committee (OIC) meeting in March 2024, the 
Committee agreed changes to OSPAR’s List of Substances/Preparations 
Used and Discharged Offshore which are Considered to Pose Little or No 
Risk to the Environment (PLONOR). This includes two inorganic 
substances, calcium bromide and sodium bromide which are used in 
Completion fluid formulations. Further work is progressing on the 
harmonisation of OSPAR’s approach to offshore chemicals and the REACH 
Regulation, now focused on the potential impact of adjustments to the 
current Harmonised Mandatory Control System (HCMS) for regulators and 
industry. OIC also agreed the report on the implementation of OSPAR 
Recommendation 2006/3 on Environmental Goals for the Discharge by the 
Offshore Industry of Chemicals that Are, or Which Contain Substances 
Identified as Candidates for Substitution – Technical and Safety Obstacles.  
Environmental maritime regulations
bp’s shipping operations are subject to extensive national and international 
regulations governing operations, training, pollution prevention, liability, and 
insurance. These include:
•Liability and spill prevention and planning requirements governing, 
among others, tankers, barges, and offshore facilities are imposed by 
OPA in US waters. OPA also mandates a levy on imported and 
domestically produced oil to fund oil spill responses. Some states, 
including Alaska, Washington, Oregon and California, impose additional 
liability for oil spills. Outside US territorial waters, bp shipping tankers are 
subject to international pollution prevention, liability, spill response and 
preparedness regulations developed through the UN’s International 
Maritime Organization (IMO), including the International Convention on 
Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, the International Convention for 
the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), the International 
Convention on Oil Pollution, Preparedness, Response and Co-operation, 
and the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution 
Damage. In April 2010, the Hazardous and Noxious Substance (HNS) 
Protocol 2010 was adopted to address issues that have inhibited 
ratification of the International Convention on Liability and 
Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of 
Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea 1996. As at 31 December 
2023, the HNS Convention had not entered into force.
•A global sulphur cap of 0.5% applies to marine fuel under MARPOL with 
a stricter 0.1% cap in environmentally sensitive areas. In order to 
comply, ships either need to consume low sulphur marine fuels, operate 
on alternative low sulphur fuels such as LNG or implement approved 
abatement technology to enable them to meet the low sulphur 
emissions requirements while continuing to use higher sulphur fuel. This 
global cap does not alter the lower 0.1% limits that apply in the sulphur 
oxides Emissions Control Areas established by the IMO.
•From 2023 all vessels over 400 gross tonnage became subject to IMO 
requirements as to energy efficiency design (EEXI) and the carbon 
intensity of operations (CII).
•Under EU legislation, maritime transport has been brought into the 
scope of the EU ETS from 2024, applicable to all vessels over 5,000 
gross tonnage calling at EU ports regardless of a vessel’s flag.Additional disclosures

•Under the  Fuel EU Maritime Regulation, from 2025 ship owners are 
required to reduce the GHG intensity of their fuel use gradually over 
time, initially by 2% by 2030 and 80% by 2050.
•From 2025 tankers calling at California’s major ports must comply with 
emission reduction and reporting requirements set by the California Air 
Resources Board (CARB), aimed at limiting emission of pollutants 
including oxides of nitrogen (Nox) and diesel particulate matter.
To meet its financial responsibility requirements, bp shipping maintains 
marine oil pollution liability insurance in respect of its operated ships to a 
maximum limit of $1 billion for each occurrence through mutual insurance 
associations (P&I Clubs), although there can be no assurance that a spill 
would necessarily be adequately covered by insurance or that liabilities 
would not exceed insurance recoveries.
International trade sanctions
During the period covered by this report, non-US subsidiaries, or other non-
US entities of bp, conducted limited activities in, or with persons from, 
certain countries identified by the US Department of State as State 
Sponsors of Terrorism or otherwise subject to US, EU and UK sanctions 
(Sanctioned Countries). In 2024, sanctions restrictions were insignificant to 
the group’s financial condition and results of operations. bp monitors its 
activities with Sanctioned Countries, persons from Sanctioned Countries 
and individuals and companies subject to US, EU and UK sanctions and 
seeks to comply with applicable sanctions laws and regulations.
bp has a 29.99% interest in and operates the Shah Deniz field in Azerbaijan 
(Shah Deniz), has a 29.99% interest in and performs some operations for a 
related gas pipeline entity, South Caucasus Pipeline Company Limited 
(SCPC), and has a 23.99% non-operating interest in a related gas marketing 
entity, Azerbaijan Gas Supply Company Limited (AGSC). Naftiran Intertrade 
Co. Limited and NICO SPV Limited (collectively, NICO) have a 10% non-
operating interest in each of Shah Deniz and SCPC and an 8% non-
operating interest in AGSC. Shah Deniz, SCPC and AGSC continue in 
operation as they were excluded from the application of US sanctions and 
fall within the exception for certain natural gas projects under Section 603 
of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (ITRA).
On 3 December 2018 bp entered into an agreement with, among others, 
SOCAR and NICO pursuant to which SOCAR pays to BP Exploration (Shah 
Deniz) Limited (BPXSD), as the Shah Deniz operator, compensation for 
NICO’s waiver of its right to lift its share of Shah Deniz condensate. Such 
amounts are used to cover cash calls to NICO in respect of operating costs 
due from NICO to BPXSD. OFAC has issued a licence in relation to these 
arrangements which expires on 15 April 2026. 
Following the imposition in 2011 of further US and EU sanctions against 
Syria, bp terminated all sales of crude oil and petroleum products into Syria, 
though bp continues to supply aviation fuel to non-governmental Syrian 
resellers outside of Syria.
bp has a joint arrangement in Cuba which imports, manufactures, markets 
and sells lubricants.
Since 2014, the US and the EU have imposed sanctions on certain sectors 
of the Russian economy (energy, finance and defence/military) and on 
certain individuals and entities, including Rosneft. These sectoral sanctions 
include restrictions on certain oil and gas activities in Russia including the 
provision of financial assistance, technical assistance, goods and services.
In response to Russia’s military action in Ukraine in 2022, the US, EU, UK 
and many other countries have imposed broad economic and trade 
sanctions. The scope of these sanctions includes restrictions on dealing 
with designated individuals and entities; restrictions on the Russian 
financial sector; blocking economic activity in certain areas of Ukraine not 
controlled by the Ukrainian government; prohibitions in relation to 
investment in Russia; prohibitions and restrictions relating to Russian origin 
oil and oil products; prohibitions and restrictions relating to Russian origin 
iron and steel products, prohibitions and restrictions relating to Russian 
origin metals, prohibitions and restrictions on the provision of certain legal 
advisory services, prohibitions and restrictions in relation to transportation, 
including shipping and aircraft; trade controls limiting the purchase and 
import of a wide range of goods from Russia, and export controls limiting 
the export of a wide range of goods and technical assistance to Russia.
In response, Russia has implemented counter-sanctions including 
restrictions on the divestment from Russian assets by foreign investors and restrictions on the payments of dividends to certain foreign shareholders, 
including those based in the UK, requiring such dividends to be paid in 
roubles into restricted bank accounts and a requirement for approval of the 
Russian government for transfers from any such bank accounts out of 
Russia.
The bp group does not source any materials directly from Russia, except 
deliveries of LNG from Russian sources under a small number of contracts 
predating the Russia and Ukraine conflict in compliance with all applicable 
sanctions. bp has also discontinued sales of our products to customers in 
Russia. Such sales were not material to the bp group. As a result, outside of 
our shareholding in Rosneft and related businesses in Russia, direct 
impacts due to exposure to Russia have not been material and are not 
expected to be material in the future. bp continues to monitor Russia 
related sanctions and other international restrictions for any impacts on our 
businesses and the exit of our shareholding in Rosneft. See page 173 for 
further information in relation to bp’s shareholding in Rosneft.
bp maintains bank accounts and has registered and paid required fees to 
maintain registrations of patents and trademarks in certain Sanctioned 
Countries.
bp has equity interests in non-operated joint arrangements with air fuel 
sellers, resellers, and fuel delivery services around the world. From time to 
time, the joint arrangement operator or other partners may sell or deliver 
fuel to airlines from Sanctioned Countries or flights to Sanctioned 
Countries, without bp’s involvement.
bp has no control over the activities non-controlled associates may 
undertake in Sanctioned Countries or with persons from Sanctioned 
Countries.
Disclosure pursuant to ITRA Section 219
To our knowledge, none of bp’s activities, transactions or dealings are 
required to be disclosed pursuant to ITRA Section 219, with the following 
possible exceptions.
In 2024, payments in relation to tax with an aggregate US dollar equivalent 
value of approximately $3,000 were made from a bp trust account held with 
Tadvin Co. to Iranian public entities on behalf of BP Iran. No gross revenues 
or net profits are attributable to BP Iran's activities.
Material contracts
On 4 April 2016 the district court approved the Consent Decree among BP 
Exploration & Production Inc., BP Corporation North America Inc., BP p.l.c., 
the United States and the states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi 
and Texas (the Gulf states) which fully and finally resolved any and all 
natural resource damages (NRD) claims of the United States, the Gulf 
states, and their respective natural resource trustees and all Clean Water 
Act (CWA) penalty claims, and certain other claims of the United States and 
the Gulf states. 
Concurrently, the definitive Settlement Agreement that bp entered into with 
the Gulf states (Settlement Agreement) with respect to State claims for 
economic, property and other losses became effective. 
bp has filed the Consent Decree and the Settlement Agreement as exhibits 
to its Annual Report and Form 20-F 2020 filed with the SEC. For further 
details of the Consent Decree and the Settlement Agreement, see Legal 
proceedings in bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2015.
Property, plant and equipment
bp has freehold and leasehold interests in real estate and other tangible 
assets in numerous countries, but no individual property is significant to the 
group as a whole. For more on the significant subsidiaries «of the group at 
31 December 2024 and the group percentage of ordinary share capital see 
Financial statements – Note 37. For information on significant joint 
ventures « and associates «of the group see Financial statements – Notes 
16 and 17.
Related party transactions
Transactions between the group and its significant joint ventures and 
associates are summarized in Financial statements – Note 16 and Note 17. 
In the ordinary course of its business, the group enters into transactions 
334 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

with various organizations with which some of its directors or executive 
officers are associated. Except as described in this report, the group did not 
have any material transactions or transactions of an unusual nature with, 
and did not make loans to, related parties in the period commencing  
1 January 2024 to 14 February 2025.
Corporate governance practices
In the US, bp ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The 
significant differences between bp’s corporate governance practices as a 
UK company and those required by NYSE listing standards for US 
companies are listed as follows:
Independence
As set out on page 75, bp has adopted separate terms of reference for the 
board and each of its committees as part of its corporate governance 
framework. The terms of reference for the board and each of its 
committees are reviewed at least a nnually. The board and audit committee 
terms of reference were last updated with effect from 1 January 2025, 
while the other three principal committees were last updated with effect 
from 25 July 2024. The terms of reference reflect the UK Corporate 
Governance Code approach to corporate governance. As such, the way in 
which bp makes determinations of directors' independence differs from the 
NYSE approach.
bp’s corporate governance framework requires that all non-executive 
directors (NEDs) be determined by the board to be ‘independent in 
character and judgement and free from any business or other relationship 
which could materially interfere with the exercise of their judgement’. The 
bp board has determined that, in its judgement, all of the NEDs are 
independent. In doing so, however, the board did not explicitly take into 
consideration the independence requirements outlined in the NYSE’s listing 
standards.
Committees
bp has a number of board committees that are broadly comparable in 
purpose and composition to those required by NYSE rules for domestic US 
companies. For instance, bp has a remuneration (rather than a 
compensation) committee. bp also has an audit committee, which NYSE 
rules require for both US companies and foreign private issuers. These 
committees are composed solely of NEDs whom the board has determined 
to be independent, in the manner described above. 
Each committee operates under its own terms of reference together with a 
set of terms applicable to all the committees (see the board committee 
reports on  pages  80-110 and bp.com/governance). 
Under US securities law and the listing standards of the NYSE, bp is 
required to have an audit committee that satisfies the requirements of Rule 
10A-3 under the Exchange Act and Section 303A.06 of the NYSE Listed 
Company Manual. bp’s audit committee complies with these requirements. 
The bp audit committee does not have direct responsibility for the 
appointment, reappointment or removal of the independent auditors. 
Instead, it follows the UK Companies Act 2006 and the UK Corporate 
Governance Code by making recommendations to the board on these 
matters for it to put forward for shareholder approval at the AGM. 
One of the NYSE’s additional requirements for the audit committee states 
that at least one member of the audit committee is to have ‘accounting or 
related financial management expertise’. The board determined that Tushar 
Morzaria possesses such expertise and also possesses the financial and 
audit committee experience set forth in both the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the SEC rules (see audit committee report on page 82 ). Mr 
Morzaria is the audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 16A of 
Form 20-F.
Summary of terms of reference for audit committee and 
remuneration committee
The audit committee’s full terms of reference are available on our website 
at bp.com/governance. A summary of the committee’s key responsibilities 
is provided below: 
•Monitor and critically assess bp’s financial statements and financial 
information, including the integrity of the financial reporting and related 
processes, context in which statements are made, compliance with 
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and financial reporting standards, including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD). 
•Assess the going concern assumption and the longer-term viability 
statement as to bp’s ability to continue to operate and meet its liabilities. 
•Review and challenge the application and appropriateness of significant 
accounting policies and financial reporting estimates and judgements. 
•Evaluate the risk to quality and effectiveness of the financial reporting 
process and, where requested by the board, advise whether the Annual 
Report and accounts are fair, balanced and understandable. 
•Review the affordability of distributions to shareholders. 
•Oversee the appointment, remuneration, independence and 
performance of the external auditor and the integrity of the audit 
process as a whole, including the engagement of the external auditor to 
supply non-audit services to bp. 
•Review the effectiveness of the internal audit function, bp’s internal 
financial controls and its systems of internal control and risk 
management. 
•Monitor the principal risks allocated to the committee by the board and 
review the mitigations proposed by management in respect of risks 
associated with bp internal financial controls and reporting 
responsibilities and such emerging risks that may fall within scope.
•Review the systems in place to enable those who work for bp to raise 
concerns about improprieties in financial reporting or other issues, and 
for those matters to be investigated. 
The remuneration committee’s full terms of reference are available on our 
website at bp.com/governance. A summary of the committee’s key 
responsibilities is provided below: 
•Recommend to the board the remuneration principles for the executive 
directors while considering remuneration and related policies for the 
employees below the board and leadership team. 
•Set and approve the terms of appointment, fees and benefits for the 
chair of the board in accordance with the policy.
•Set and approve the terms of engagement, remuneration, benefits and 
termination of employment for the executive directors, leadership team, 
chief internal auditor, head of ethics and compliance and the company 
secretary in accordance with the policy. 
•Prepare the annual remuneration report to shareholders to outline policy 
implementation.
•Approve the principles of any equity plan that requires shareholder 
approval. 
•Ensure termination terms and payments to executive directors and the 
leadership team are appropriate and fair. 
•Receive and consider regular updates on workforce views and 
engagement initiatives related to remuneration, insights and data from 
pay ratios and potential pay gaps as appropriate.
•Maintain appropriate dialogue with shareholders on remuneration 
matters.
Shareholder approval of equity compensation plans
The NYSE rules for US companies require that shareholders must be given 
the opportunity to vote on all equity-compensation plans and material 
revisions to those plans. bp complies with UK requirements that are similar 
to the NYSE rules. The board, however, does not explicitly take into 
consideration the NYSE’s detailed definition of what are considered 
‘material revisions’. 
Item 16J insider trading policy
The board has approved a share dealing policy governing the acquisition, 
sale and other dispositions of the company's securities by employees, 
contractors, officers and members of the board of the company.
The bp share dealing policy is included in this Form 20-F as Exhibit 11.2. 
Code of ethics
The company has adopted a code of ethics for its chief executive officer, 
chief financial officer, SVP accounting, reporting and control and SVP 
internal audit whose roles are equivalent to the SEC roles as required by the 
provisions of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules 
issued by the SEC. There have been no waivers from the code of ethics 
relating to any officers. A copy of the code of ethics can be found at 
bp.com/codeofethics.Additional disclosures
« See glossary on page 351 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 335

The NYSE rules require that US companies adopt and disclose a code of 
business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees. bp has 
adopted a code of conduct, which applies to all employees, officers and 
members of the board. This was updated and published in January 2023, 
with certain elements further updated and published in June 2024. In 
addition, bp has adopted a code of ethics as described above for the chief 
executive officer, chief financial officer, SVP accounting, reporting and 
control and SVP internal audit as required by the SEC. bp considers that 
these codes and policies address the matters specified in the NYSE rules 
for US companies. During 2021, the board adopted a diversity policy, which 
requires it to encourage a diverse and inclusive working environment in the 
boardroom. The policy was  most recently reviewed by the board in 2024, 
and amendments were made to reflect regulatory changes and market 
practice. The updated policy was then approved with effect from 1 January 
2025.
Controls and procedures
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
The company maintains ‘disclosure controls and procedures’, as such term 
is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that 
information required to be disclosed in reports the company files or 
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and 
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange 
Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated 
and communicated to management, including the company’s group chief 
executive and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely 
decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our 
management, including the group chief executive and chief financial officer, 
recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed 
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the 
objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Because of 
the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can 
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud 
within the company, if any, have been detected. Further, in the design and 
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures our management 
necessarily was required to apply its judgement in evaluating the costs and 
benefits of possible control and procedure design options. Also, we have 
investments in unconsolidated entities. As we do not control these entities, 
our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are 
necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect 
to our consolidated subsidiaries «. Because of the inherent limitations in a 
cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. The company’s disclosure controls and 
procedures have been designed to meet, and management believes that 
they meet, reasonable assurance standards.
The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s group 
chief executive and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness 
of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange 
Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. 
Based on that evaluation, the group chief executive and chief financial 
officer have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and 
procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.
Management’s report on internal control over financial 
reporting
Management of bp is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control over financial reporting. bp’s internal control over 
financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the 
principal executive and financial officers to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of bp’s 
financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with 
IFRS.
As of the end of the 2024 fiscal year, management conducted an 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
in accordance with the criteria in the UK Financial Reporting Council’s 
Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting relating to internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment, management has determined that bp’s internal 
control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2024 was effective.
Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over 
financial reporting excluded bp bioenergy (formerly called bp Bunge 
Bioenergia) and Lightsource bp which were acquired on 1 October 2024, 
and 24 October 2024, respectively. bp bioenergy’s financial statement line 
items comprise 2.1% and 0.9% of net and total assets respectively, 0.3% of 
sales and other operating revenues, and (4.5)% of profit (loss) for the year 
of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year 
ended 31 December 2024. Lightsource bp’s financial statement line items 
comprise 6.3% and 2.4% of net and total assets respectively, 0.1% of sales 
and other operating revenues, and (5.7)% of profit (loss) for the year of the 
consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 31 
December 2024. These exclusions are in accordance with the general 
guidance issued by the SEC that an assessment of a recent business 
combination may be omitted from managements report on internal control 
over financial reporting in the first year of consolidation. 
The company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies 
and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions 
of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
IFRS and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance 
with authorizations of management and the directors of bp; and provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of bp’s assets that could have a 
material effect on our financial statements. bp’s internal control over 
financial reporting as of 31 December 2024 has been audited by Deloitte 
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their 
report appearing on page 139 of bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting
There were no changes in the group’s internal control over financial 
reporting that occurred during the period covered by the Form 20-F that 
have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our 
internal control over financial reporting.
Cyber security
Governance
The board oversees bp’s internal control and risk management framework. 
The board is supported by the safety and sustainability committee which 
oversees cyber security risk and received reports from bp’s chief 
information security officer (CISO) on cyber security incidents at every 
committee meeting in 2024, including information on bp’s response to 
incidents. This allows an ongoing assessment by the committee of the 
effectiveness of bp’s overall cyber security programme. A session is held 
once a year to review bp’s roadmap and progress for addressing cyber 
security risk. Read more in the safety and sustainability committee report 
on page 80.
At management level, assessment and management of material risks from 
cyber security threats is led by bp’s executive vice president of technology, 
a member of bp’s leadership team with deep experience in bp’s engineering 
and operations functions, with support from bp’s CISO, who has over 20 
years of experience in the information technology industry. bp’s digital 
safety operational risk committee brings together additional senior 
members of bp’s digital leadership team to assist in ensuring that cyber 
security risks across bp are identified, understood, accurately quantified 
and are managed in accordance with bp’s internal controls framework.
Risk management and strategy
bp has implemented a threat-focused strategy to assess cyber security 
risks and protect against, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber 
attacks. bp maintains internal teams focused on cyber security intelligence 
and emergency response to monitor the external threat landscape and the 
threats to bp’s IT and operational technology infrastructure. bp partners 
with third-party specialists to augment its in-house capabilities as 
necessary. bp has a defined protocol for cyber incident notification based 
on severity and bp’s internal cyber security teams brief the CISO, 
336 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

technology EVP, other senior leadership and relevant board and 
management committees about incidents on an as needed basis.
Cyber security risk management is integrated into bp’s overall risk 
management process. bp’s entities are required to identify, assess and 
report key risks, including cyber security risks, to relevant members of 
senior leadership. bp maintains additional procedures to manage cyber 
security risks related to third-party service providers, including conducting 
information security assessments for certain providers, providing relevant 
trainings for bp employees, and maintaining information security 
requirements for suppliers.
Our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition have 
not been materially affected by risks from cyber security threats, including 
as a result of previously identified cyber security incidents. For more 
information on our cyber security related risks, see Risk Factors (pages 
79-67).
Principal accountant's fees and services
The audit committee has established policies and procedures for the 
engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte 
LLP, to render audit and certain assurance services. The policy provides for 
pre-approval by the audit committee of specifically defined audit, audit 
related, non-audit and other services that are not prohibited by regulatory or 
other professional requirements. Deloitte is engaged for these services 
when its expertise and experience of bp are important. Most of this work is 
of an audit nature.The audit committee, CFO and SVP accounting, reporting 
and control, monitor overall compliance with bp’s policy on audit-related 
and non-audit services, including whether the necessary pre-approvals have 
been obtained. The committee regularly reviews the policy, including in 
2022, when it was updated to remove restrictions on EY following bp's 
announcement on 27 February 2022 of its intention to exit its interests in 
Rosneft and capture additional detail for the processes applicable to 
separately listed bp entities. 
Under the policy, pre-approval is given for specific services within the 
following categories: i) audit-related services, such as those required by law 
or where the auditor is best placed to undertake such work on similar 
terms, ii) non-audit services required by law, such as reporting required by a 
regulatory authority, and iii) other services, such as additional assurance or 
updates on applicable law and accounting standards. bp operates a two-
tier system for audit and non-audit services. For audit-related services, the 
audit committee has a pre-approved aggregate level, within which specific 
work may be approved by management. Non-audit services are pre-
approved for management to authorize per individual engagement, but 
above a defined level must be approved by the chair of the audit committee 
or the full committee. The audit committee has delegated to the chair of the 
audit committee authority to approve permitted services provided that any 
decisions are reported to the committee at its next scheduled meeting. Any 
proposed service not included in the approved service list must be 
approved in advance of commencing the engagement by the audit 
committee chair or the full audit committee depending on the level of fee 
payable. 
The audit committee evaluates the performance of the auditor each year. 
The audit fees payable to Deloitte are reviewed by the committee in the 
context of other global companies for cost effectiveness. The committee 
keeps under review the scope and results of audit work and the 
independence and objectivity of the auditor. External regulation and bp 
policy requires the auditor to rotate its lead audit partner every five years. 
See Financial statements – Note 36 and audit committee report on page 82 
for details of fees for services provided by the auditor. 
Additional Directors’ report disclosures
This section of bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 forms part of the 
Directors’ report. Certain information has been included in the Strategic 
report that would otherwise be required to be disclosed in the Directors' 
report, as noted below.
Indemnity provisionsIn accordance with bp’s Articles of Association, on appointment each 
director is granted an indemnity from the company in respect of liabilities 
incurred as a result of their office, to the extent permitted by law. These 
indemnities were in force throughout the financial year and at the date of 
this report. In respect of those liabilities for which directors may not be 
indemnified, the company maintained a directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance policy throughout 2024. During the year, a review of the terms 
and scope of the policy was undertaken as part of the annual renewal. 
Although their defence costs may be met, neither the company’s indemnity 
nor insurance provides cover in the event that the director is proved to have 
acted fraudulently or dishonestly. One of the group’s subsidiaries « is a 
trustee of the UK pension scheme. Each director of that subsidiary is 
granted an indemnity from the company in respect of liabilities incurred as 
a result of such a subsidiary’s activities as a trustee of the pension scheme, 
to the extent permitted by law. These indemnities were in force throughout 
the financial year and as at the date of this report.

Markets and market prices
The primary market for the company’s ordinary shares (trading symbol 
‘BP’), 8% cumulative first preference shares (trading symbol ‘BP.A’) and 9% 
cumulative second preference shares (trading symbol ‘BP.B’) is the London 
Stock Exchange (LSE). The company’s ordinary shares are a constituent 
element of the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index. 
In the US, the company’s securities are listed and traded on the New York 
Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of ADSs (trading symbol ‘BP’), for which 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is the depositary (the Depositary) and transfer 
agent. The Depositary’s principal office is 383 Madison Avenue, Floor 11, 
New York, NY, 10179, US. Each ADS represents six ordinary shares. ADSs 
are evidenced by American depositary receipts (ADRs), which may be 
issued in either certificated or book entry form. 
The company’s ordinary shares are also traded in the form of a global 
depositary certificate representing the company’s ordinary shares on the 
Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The company delisted from the Hamburg and 
Düsseldorf Stock Exchanges on 20 December 2024 and announced its 
intention to delist from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on 18 April 2024. 
On 14 February 2025, 698,589,844 ADSs (equivalent to approximately 
4,191,539,064 ordinary shares or some 26.19% of the total issued share 
capital, excluding shares held in treasury) were outstanding and were held 
by approximately 58,929 ADS holders. Of these, about 58,209 had 
registered addresses in the US at that date. One of the registered holders of 
ADSs represents approximately 1,371,412  underlying holders.
On 14 February 2025, there were approximately 192,951 ordinary 
shareholders. Of these shareholders, around 1,464 had registered 
addresses in the US and held a total of some 3,840,494 ordinary shares. On  
14 February 2025, there were approximately 1,074 preference shareholders. 
Of these shareholders, around 14 had registered addresses in the US and 
held a total of some 2,773 preference shares.
Since a number of the ordinary shares and ADSs were held by brokers and 
other nominees, the number of holders in the US may not be representative 
of the number of beneficial holders or their respective country of residence.
Dividends
The company’s current policy is to pay interim dividends on a quarterly 
basis on its ordinary shares.
Our policy is also to announce dividends for ordinary shares in US dollars 
and state an equivalent sterling dividend. Dividends on the company's 
ordinary shares will be paid in sterling and on the company's ADSs in US 
dollars. The rate of exchange used to determine the sterling amount 
equivalent is the average of the market exchange rates in London over the 
three business days prior to the sterling equivalent announcement date. 
The directors may choose to declare dividends in any currency provided 
that a sterling equivalent is announced. It is not the company’s intention to 
change its current policy of announcing dividends on ordinary shares in US 
dollars.
Information regarding dividends announced and paid by the company on 
ordinary shares and preference shares is provided in the consolidated 
Financial statements – Note 10.
A Scrip Dividend Programme (Scrip Programme) was approved by 
shareholders in 2010 and was renewed for a further three years at the 2021 
AGM. It enabled the company's ordinary shareholders and ADS holders to 
elect to receive dividends by way of new fully paid ordinary shares (or ADSs 
in the case of ADS holders) instead of cash. The operation of the Scrip 
Programme is always subject to the directors’ decision to make the Scrip 
Programme offer available in respect of any particular dividend. 
The company announced on 29 October 2019 and as part of all subsequent 
quarterly results announcements made since, that the board had 
suspended the Scrip Programme in respect of those quarterly dividends. 
The company does not expect to offer a scrip election for the foreseeable 
future. Ordinary shareholders and ADS holders (subject to certain 
exceptions) may be able to participate in dividend reinvestment plans. Any 
decisions with respect to future dividends will be made by the board of BP 
p.l.c. following the end of each quarter.Future dividends will be dependent on future earnings, the financial 
condition of the group, the Risk factors set out on page 65 and other 
matters that may affect the business of the group set out in Our strategy on 
page 8 and in Liquidity and capital resources on page 316.
The quarterly dividend which is expected to be paid on  28 March 2025 in 
respect of the fourth quarter 2024 is 8.000 cents per ordinary share 
($0.48000 per American Depositary Share (ADS)). The corresponding 
amount in sterling will be announced on 17 March 2025. 
The following table shows dividends announced and paid by the company 
per ADS for the past five years.

There are no UK foreign exchange controls or other restrictions on the 
import or export of capital by, or on the payment of dividends to, non-
resident holders of BP p.l.c. shares, or that materially affect the conduct of

these restrictions can be complied with in law.
Shareholder taxation information
This section describes the material US federal income tax and UK taxation 
consequences of owning ordinary shares or ADSs to a US holder who holds 
the ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets for tax purposes. This section 
does not discuss tax consequences arising under the Medicare contribution 
tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax. It also does 
not apply inter alia to members of special classes of holders some of which 
may be subject to other rules, including: tax-exempt entities, life insurance 
companies, dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect a mark-to-
market method of accounting for securities holdings, holders that, actually 
or constructively, hold 10% or more of the company’s shares (as measured 
by voting power or value), holders that hold the shares or ADSs as part of a 
straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction, holders that purchase or 
sell the shares or ADSs as part of a wash sale for US federal income tax 
purposes, or holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar. In 
addition, if a partnership holds the shares or ADSs, the US federal income 
tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner 
and the tax treatment of the partnership and may not be described fully 
below.
A US holder is any beneficial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs that is for 
US federal income tax purposes (1) a citizen or resident of the US, (2) a US 
domestic corporation, (3) an estate whose income is subject to US federal 
income taxation regardless of its source, or (4) a trust if a US court can 
exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or 
more US persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the 
trust.
This section is based on the tax laws of the United States, including the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing 
and proposed US Treasury regulations thereunder, published rulings and 
court decisions, and the taxation laws of the UK, all as currently in effect, as 
well as the income tax convention between the US and the UK that entered 
into force on 31 March 2003 (the Treaty). These laws are subject to change, 
possibly on a retroactive basis. This section further assumes that each 
obligation under the terms of the deposit agreement relating to bp ADSs 
and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.
342 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

For purposes of the Treaty and the estate and gift tax convention between 
the US and the UK that entered into force on 11 November 1979 (the Estate 
Tax Convention) and for US federal income tax and UK taxation purposes, a 
holder of ADRs evidencing ADSs will be treated as the owner of the 
company’s ordinary shares represented by those ADRs. Exchanges of 
ordinary shares for ADRs and ADRs for ordinary shares generally will not be 
subject to US federal income tax or to UK taxation other than stamp duty or 
stamp duty reserve tax, as described below.
Investors should consult their own tax advisor regarding the US federal, 
state and local, UK and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of 
ordinary shares and ADSs in their particular circumstances, and in 
particular whether they are eligible for the benefits of the Treaty in respect 
of their investment in the shares or ADSs.
Taxation of dividends
UK taxation
Under current UK taxation law, no withholding tax will be deducted from 
dividends paid by the company, including dividends paid to US holders. 
A US holder that is a company resident for tax purposes in the UK or trading 
in the UK through a permanent establishment generally will not be taxable 
in the UK on a dividend it receives from the company. A US holder who is an 
individual resident for tax purposes in the UK is subject to UK tax on 
dividends received from the company, including dividends paid but 
reinvested under any dividend reinvestment plan for ordinary shareholders, 
that are in excess of the annual dividend allowance. However, if the 
shareholder’s dividend income is covered by their personal allowance of 
£12,570 (for 2024/25) after taking into account other sources of income, no 
UK tax will be payable on their dividend income.
For 2024/25 the dividend allowance is £500 which means there is no UK 
tax due on the first £500 of dividends received. Dividends above this level 
are subject to tax at 8.75% for basic tax payers, 33.75% for higher rate tax 
payers and 39.35% for additional rate tax payers.
Although the first £500 of dividend income is not subject to UK income tax, 
it does not reduce the total income for tax purposes. Dividends within the 
dividend allowance still count towards basic or higher rate bands, and may 
therefore affect the rate of tax paid on dividends received in excess of the 
£500 allowance. For instance, if an individual has an annual gross salary of 
£55,000 and also receives a dividend of £12,000 they will be subject to the 
following scenario. The individual's personal allowance and the basic rate 
tax band will be used up by the gross salary. The remaining part of the 
salary and the whole of the dividend will be subject to tax at the higher rate, 
although the dividend allowance will reduce the amount of dividend subject 
to tax. The dividend of £12,000 will be reduced by the dividend allowance of 
£500 leaving taxable dividend income of £11,500. The dividend will be taxed 
at 33.75% so that the total tax payable on the dividends is £3,881.
An individual US holder should inform HM Revenue & Customs each year 
for which that US holder receives dividends chargeable to UK tax. If a US 
holder needs to report to HMRC and already files a self-assessment tax 
return in the UK, the US holder should include the dividend income in that 
return and submit it by the deadline. If the US holder does not file a self-
assessment return, the US holder should inform HM Revenue & Customs 
by 5 October. How the income is reported and taxed will depend on the size 
of the dividend income for that tax year. If the US holder received dividend 
income up to £10,000, the US holder can inform HM Revenue & Customs by 
either asking to update his or her tax code or contacting the helpline. If the 
US holder’s dividend income is over £10,000, he or she will need to fill out a 
self-assessment tax return. For this, the US holder will need to register for 
self-assessment by 5 October. A US holder will not need to report his or her 
dividend income to HM Revenue & Customs if the amount is within his or 
her dividend allowance for that tax year.
US federal income taxation
A US holder is subject to US federal income taxation on the gross amount 
of any dividend paid by the company (including dividends paid but 
reinvested under the Global Invest Direct (GID) Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
for ADS holders) out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits (as 
determined for US federal income tax purposes). Dividends paid to a non-
corporate US holder that constitute qualified dividend income will be 
taxable to the holder at a preferential rate, provided that the holder has a 
holding period in the ordinary shares or ADSs of more than 60 days during 
the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and meets other holding period requirements. Dividends paid by the company 
with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs will generally be qualified 
dividend income.
For US federal income tax purposes, a dividend must be included in income 
when the US holder, in the case of ordinary shares, or the Depositary, in the 
case of ADSs, actually or constructively receives the dividend and will not 
be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US 
corporations in respect of dividends received from other US corporations. 
US ADS holders should consult their own tax advisor regarding the US tax 
treatment of the dividend fee in respect of dividends. Dividends will 
generally be income from sources outside the US and generally will be 
‘passive category income’ for purposes of computing a US holder’s foreign 
tax credit limitation.
As noted above in UK taxation, a US holder will not be subject to UK 
withholding tax. Accordingly, the receipt of a dividend will not entitle the US 
holder to a foreign tax credit.
The amount of the dividend distribution on the ordinary shares that is paid 
in pounds sterling will be the US dollar value of the pounds sterling 
payments made, determined at the spot pounds sterling/US dollar rate on 
the date the dividend is distributed, regardless of whether the payment is, in 
fact, converted into US dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from 
currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date the pounds 
sterling dividend payment is distributed to the date the payment is 
converted into US dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will 
not be eligible for the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income. The 
gain or loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the US for 
foreign tax credit limitation purposes.
Distributions in excess of the company’s earnings and profits, as 
determined for US federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a return 
of capital to the extent of the US holder’s basis in the ordinary shares or 
ADSs and thereafter as capital gain, subject to taxation as described in 
'Taxation of capital gains – US federal income taxation' section below.
In addition, the taxation of dividends may be subject to the rules for passive 
foreign investment companies (PFIC), described below under ‘Taxation of 
capital gains – US federal income taxation’. Distributions made by a PFIC 
do not constitute qualified dividend income and are not eligible for the 
preferential tax rate applicable to such income.
Taxation of capital gains
UK taxation
A US holder may be liable for both UK and US tax in respect of a gain on the 
disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs if the US holder is (1) resident for tax 
purposes in the UK at the date of disposal, (2) person who (a) has left the 
UK; (b) was resident in the UK for four out of the seven years before the 
year of departure; (c) acquired the shares before leaving the UK; (d) sold the 
shares while not resident in the UK; and (e) returns to the UK within a period 
not exceeding five complete tax years after departure, (3) a US domestic 
corporation resident in the UK by reason of its business being managed or 
controlled in the UK, or (4) a citizen of the US that carries on a trade or 
profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency or a 
corporation that carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK, 
through a permanent establishment, and that has used, held, or acquired 
the ordinary shares or ADSs for the purposes of such trade, profession or 
vocation of such branch, agency or permanent establishment. 
Under the Treaty, capital gains on dispositions of ordinary shares or ADSs 
generally will be subject to tax only in the jurisdiction of residence of the 
relevant holder as determined under both the laws of the UK and the US 
and as required by the terms of the Treaty.
Under the Treaty, individuals who are residents of either the UK or the US 
and who have been residents of the other jurisdiction (the US or the UK, as 
the case may be) at any time during the six years immediately preceding 
the relevant disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to tax with 
respect to capital gains arising from a disposition of ordinary shares or 
ADSs of the company not only in the jurisdiction of which the holder is 
resident at the time of the disposition but also in the other jurisdiction.
The UK Capital Gains Tax rate is dependent on the level of an individual’s 
taxable income. For 2024/25, the revised rates are as follows:Shareholder information
« See glossary on page 351 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 343

Gains up until 29 October 2024, where total taxable income and gains after 
all allowable deductions are less than the upper limit of the basic rate 
income tax band of £37,700 (for 2024/25), the rate of Capital Gains Tax will 
be 10%. For gains (and any parts of gains) above that limit the rate will be 
20%.
Gains from 30 October 2024 onwards, where total taxable income and 
gains after all allowable deductions are less than the upper limit of the 
basic rate income tax band of £37,700 (for 2024/25), the rate of Capital 
Gains Tax will be 18%. For gains (and any parts of gains) above that limit 
the rate will be 24%. 
An individual may be entitled to a capital gains tax free allowance, 
depending on that individual’s circumstances (in particular, election for the 
remittance basis of taxation). For individuals who are entitled to the 
allowance for 2024/25, this has been set at £3,000. Corporation tax on 
chargeable gains is levied at 25% for companies from 1 April 2023.
US federal income taxation
A US holder who sells or otherwise disposes of ordinary shares or ADSs will 
recognize a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to 
the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realized on the 
disposition and the US holder’s tax basis, determined in US dollars, in the 
ordinary shares or ADSs. Any such capital gain or loss generally will be 
long-term gain or loss, subject to tax at a preferential rate for a non-
corporate US holder, if the US holder’s holding period for such ordinary 
shares or ADSs exceeds one year. The tax basis of shares acquired through 
reinvested dividends under the GID Dividend Reinvestment Plan for ADS 
holders is equal to the fair market value of the stock on the investment 
date. The holding period for shares acquired under the plan begins the day 
after the applicable investment date.
Gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs 
will generally be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax 
credit limitation purposes. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to 
limitations.
We do not believe that ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as stock of a 
passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for US federal income tax 
purposes, but this conclusion is a factual determination that is made 
annually and thus is subject to change. If we are treated as a PFIC, unless a 
US holder elects to be taxed annually on a mark-to-market basis with 
respect to ordinary shares or ADSs, any gain realized on the sale or other 
disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs would in general not be treated as 
capital gain. Instead, a US holder would be treated as if he or she had 
realized such gain rateably over the holding period for ordinary shares or 
ADSs and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year 
to which the gain was allocated, in addition to which an interest charge in 
respect of the tax attributable to each such year would apply. Certain 
‘excess distributions’ would be similarly treated if we were treated as a 
PFIC.
Additional tax considerations
Scrip Programme
Until the publication of the 2019 third quarter results, the company had an 
optional Scrip Programme, wherein holders of bp ordinary shares or ADSs 
could elect to receive any dividends in the form of new fully paid ordinary 
shares or ADSs of the company instead of cash. Please consult your tax 
advisor for the consequences to you.
UK inheritance tax
The Estate Tax Convention applies to UK inheritance tax. ADSs held by an 
individual who is domiciled for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention 
in the US and is for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention a national of 
the US and not a national of the UK will not be subject to UK inheritance tax 
on the individual’s death or on transfer during the individual’s lifetime 
unless, among other things, the ADSs are part of the business property of a 
permanent establishment situated in the UK or a fixed base used for the 
performance of independent personal services. In the exceptional case 
where ADSs are subject to both inheritance tax and US federal gift or estate 
tax, the Estate Tax Convention generally provides for tax payable in the US 
to be credited against tax payable in the UK or for tax paid in the UK to be 
credited against tax payable in the US, based on priority rules set forth in 
the Estate Tax Convention.UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
The statements below relate to what is understood to be the current

matter or thing done or to be done in the UK, no UK stamp duty is payable 
on the acquisition or transfer of ADSs. Neither will an agreement to transfer 
ADSs in the form of ADRs give rise to a liability to stamp duty reserve tax.
Purchases of ordinary shares, as opposed to ADSs, through the CREST 
system of paperless share transfers will be subject to stamp duty reserve 
tax at 0.5%. The charge will arise as soon as there is an agreement for the 
transfer of the shares (or, in the case of a conditional agreement, when the 
condition is fulfilled). The stamp duty reserve tax will apply to agreements 
to transfer ordinary shares even if the agreement is made outside the UK 
between two non-residents. Purchases of ordinary shares outside the 
CREST system are subject either to stamp duty at a rate of £5 per £1,000 
(or part, unless the stamp duty is less than £5, when no stamp duty is 
charged), or stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5%. Stamp duty and stamp duty 
reserve tax are generally the liability of the purchaser.
A subsequent transfer of ordinary shares to the Depositary’s nominee will 
give rise to further stamp duty at the rate of £1.50 per £100 (or part) or 
stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 1.5% of the value of the ordinary 
shares at the time of the transfer. For ADR holders electing to receive ADSs 
instead of cash, after the 2012 first quarter dividend payment, HM 
Revenue & Customs no longer seeks to impose 1.5% stamp duty reserve 
tax on issues of UK shares and securities to non-EU clearance services and 
depositary receipt systems.

Annual general meeting (AGM)
The 2025 AGM is scheduled to be held on Thursday 17 April 2025 at 
11:00am BST. A separate notice convening the meeting is distributed to 
shareholders, which includes an explanation of the items of business to be 
considered at the meeting.
All resolutions for which notice has been given will be decided on a poll. 
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as 
auditors and a resolution for their reappointment is included in the Notice of 
bp Annual General Meeting 2025.
Memorandum and Articles of Association
The following summarizes certain provisions of the company’s 
Memorandum and Articles of Association and applicable English law. This 
summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the UK Companies Act 
2006 (the Act) and the company’s Memorandum and Articles of 
Association. The Memorandum and Articles of Association are available 
online at bp.com/usefuldocs.
The company’s Articles of Association may be amended by a special 
resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders. At the AGM held on 21 
May 2018 shareholders voted to adopt new Articles of Association to 
reflect developments in market practice and to provide clarification and 
additional flexibility where necessary or appropriate.
Objects and purposes
BP p.l.c. is a public company limited by shares and registered in England 
and Wales with the registered number 102498. The provisions regulating 
the operations of the company, known as its ‘objects’, were historically 
stated in a company’s memorandum. The Act abolished the need to have 
object provisions and so at the AGM held on 15 April 2010 shareholders 
approved the removal of its objects clause together with all other provisions 
of its Memorandum that, by virtue of the Act, are treated as forming part of 
the company’s Articles of Association.
Directors and secretary
The business and affairs of the company shall be managed by the 
directors. The company’s Articles of Association provide that any person 
may be appointed by the existing directors or by the shareholders in a 
general meeting either as a replacement for another director or as an 
additional director. Any person appointed by the directors will hold office 
only until the next general meeting, notice of which is first given after their 
appointment and will then be eligible for re-election by the shareholders. A 
director may be removed by the company as provided for by applicable law 
and shall vacate office in certain circumstances as set out in the Articles of 
Association. In addition, the company may, by special resolution, remove a 
director before the expiration of his/her period of office and, subject to the 
Articles of Association, may by ordinary resolution appoint another person 
to be a director instead. There is no requirement for a director to retire on 
reaching any age.
The Articles of Association place a general prohibition on a director voting 
in respect of any contract or arrangement in which the director has a 
material interest other than by virtue of such director’s interest in shares in 
the company. However, in the absence of some other material interest not 
indicated below, a director is entitled to vote and to be counted in a quorum 
for the purpose of any vote relating to a resolution concerning the following 
matters:
•The giving of security or indemnity with respect to any money lent or 
obligation taken by the director at the request or benefit of the company 
or any of its subsidiary undertakings.
•The giving of security or indemnity to a third party with respect to any 
debt or obligation of the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings 
for which the director has assumed responsibility.
•Any proposal in which the director is interested, concerning the 
underwriting of company securities or debentures or the giving of any 
security to a third party for a debt or obligation of the company or any of 
its subsidiary undertakings.Shareholder information
« See glossary on page 351 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 345

•Any proposal concerning any other company in which the director is 
interested, directly or indirectly (whether as an officer or shareholder or 
otherwise) provided that the director and persons connected with such 
director are not the holder or holders of 1% or more of the voting interest 
in the shares of such company.
•Any proposal concerning the purchase or maintenance of any insurance 
policy under which the director may benefit.
•Any proposal concerning the giving to the director of any other 
indemnity which is on substantially the same terms as indemnities given 
or to be given to all of the other directors or to the funding by the 
company of his expenditure on defending proceedings or the doing by 
the company of anything to enable the director to avoid incurring such 
expenditure where all other directors have been given or are to be given 
substantially the same arrangements.
•Any proposal concerning an arrangement for the benefit of the 
employees and directors or former employees and former directors of 
the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, including but without 
being limited to a retirement benefits scheme and an employees’ share 
scheme, which does not accord to any director any privilege or 
advantage not generally accorded to the employees or former 
employees to whom the arrangement relates.
The Act requires a director of a company who is in any way interested in a 
contract or proposed contract with the company to declare the nature of 
the director’s interest at a meeting of the directors of the company. The 
definition of ‘interest’ includes the interests of spouses, children, companies 
and trusts. The Act also requires that a director must avoid a situation 
where a director has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that 
conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the company’s interests. The Act 
allows directors of public companies to authorize such conflicts where 
appropriate, if a company’s Articles of Association so permit. The 
company’s Articles of Association permit the authorization of such 
conflicts. The directors may exercise all the powers of the company to 
borrow money, except that the amount remaining undischarged of all 
moneys borrowed by the company shall not, without approval of the 
shareholders, exceed two times the amount paid up on the share capital 
plus the aggregate of the amount of the capital and revenue reserves of the 
company and its subsidiary undertakings incorporated in the UK. Variation 
of the borrowing power of the board may only be affected by amending the 
Articles of Association.
Remuneration of non-executive directors shall be determined in the 
aggregate by resolution of the shareholders. Remuneration of executive 
directors is determined by the remuneration committee. This committee is 
made up of non-executive directors only. There is no requirement of share 
ownership for a director’s qualification.
The Articles of Association provide entitlement to the directors’ pensions 
and death and disability benefits to the directors’ relations and dependants 
respectively.
The circumstances in which a director’s office will automatically terminate 
include, amongst others: when a director ceases to hold an executive office 
of the company and the directors resolve that they should cease to be a 
director; if a medical practitioner provides an opinion that a director has 
become incapable of acting as a director and may remain so incapable for 
more than a further three months and the directors resolve that they should 
cease to be a director; and if all of the other directors vote in favour of a 
resolution stating that the person should cease to be a director.
The company secretary has express powers to delegate any of the powers 
or discretions conferred on him or her.
Dividend rights; other rights to share in company profits; 
capital calls
Shareholders of the company may, by resolution, declare dividends but no 
such dividend may be declared in excess of the amount recommended by 
the directors. The directors may also pay interim dividends without 
obtaining shareholder approval. No dividend may be paid other than out of 
profits available for distribution, as determined under IFRS and the Act. 
Dividends on ordinary shares are payable only after payment of dividends 
on bp preference shares. Any dividend unclaimed after a period of 10 years 
from the date of declaration of such dividend shall be forfeited and reverts 
to bp. If the company exercises its right to forfeit shares and sells shares 
belonging to an untraced shareholder then any entitlement to claim 
dividends or other monies unclaimed in respect of those shares will be for a period of 12 months after the sale. The company may take such steps as 
the directors decide are appropriate in the circumstances to trace the 
member entitled and the sale may be made at such time and on such terms 
as the directors may decide.
The directors have the power to declare and pay dividends in any currency 
provided that a sterling equivalent is announced. It is not the company’s 
intention to change its current policy of paying dividends in US dollars. At 
the company’s AGM held on 15 April 2010, shareholders approved the 
introduction of a Scrip Dividend Programme (Scrip Programme) and to 
include provisions in the Articles of Association to enable the company to 
operate the Scrip Programme. The Scrip Programme was renewed at the 
company’s AGM held on 25 April 2024 for a further three years. The Scrip 
Programme enables ordinary shareholders and bp ADS holders to elect to 
receive new fully paid ordinary shares (or bp ADSs in the case of bp ADS 
holders) instead of cash. The operation of the Scrip Programme is always 
subject to the directors’ decision to make the scrip offer available in respect 
of any particular dividend. Should the directors decide not to offer the scrip 
in respect of any particular dividend, cash will automatically be paid instead. 
The directors may determine in relation to any scrip dividend plan or 
programme how the costs of the programme will be met, the minimum 
number of ordinary shares required in order to be able to participate in the 
programme and any arrangements to deal with legal and practical 
difficulties in any particular territory.
Apart from shareholders’ rights to share in bp’s profits by dividend (if any is 
declared or announced), the Articles of Association provide that the 
directors may set aside:
•A special reserve fund out of the balance of profits each year to make up 
any deficit of cumulative dividend on the bp preference shares.
•A general reserve out of the balance of profits each year, which shall be 
applicable for any purpose to which the profits of the company may 
properly be applied. This may include capitalization of such sum, 
pursuant to an ordinary shareholders’ resolution, and distribution to 
shareholders as if it were distributed by way of a dividend on the 
ordinary shares or in paying up in full unissued ordinary shares for 
allotment and distribution as bonus shares.
Any such sums so deposited may be distributed in accordance with the 
manner of distribution of dividends as described above.
Holders of shares are not subject to calls on capital by the company, 
provided that the amounts required to be paid on issue have been paid off. 
All shares are fully paid.
Share transfers and share certificates
The directors may permit transfers to be effected other than by an 
instrument in writing. Share certificates will not be required to be issued by 
the company if they are not required by law. 
The company may charge an administrative fee in the event that a 
shareholder wishes to replace two or more certificates representing shares 
with a single certificate or wishes to surrender a single certificate and 
replace it with two or more certificates. All certificates are sent at the 
member’s risk.
Voting rights
The Articles of Association of the company provide that voting on 
resolutions at a shareholders’ meeting will be decided on a poll other than 
resolutions of a procedural nature, which may be decided on a show of 
hands. If voting is on a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or 
by proxy has one vote for every ordinary share held and two votes for every 
£5 in nominal amount of bp preference shares held. If voting is on a show 
of hands, each shareholder who is present at the meeting in person or 
whose duly appointed proxy is present in person will have one vote, 
regardless of the number of shares held, unless a poll is requested.
Shareholders do not have cumulative voting rights.
For the purposes of determining which persons are entitled to attend or 
vote at a shareholders’ meeting and how many votes such persons may 
cast, the company may specify in the notice of the meeting a time, not 
more than 48 hours before the time of the meeting, by which a person who 
holds shares in registered form must be entered on the company’s register 
of members in order to have the right to attend or vote at the meeting or to 
appoint a proxy to do so.
346 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

Holders on record of ordinary shares may appoint a proxy, including a 
beneficial owner of those shares, to attend, speak and vote on their behalf 
at any shareholders’ meeting, provided that a duly completed proxy form is 
received not less than 48 hours (or such shorter time as the directors may 
determine) before the time of the meeting or adjourned meeting or, where 
the poll is to be taken after the date of the meeting, not less than 24 hours 
(or such shorter time as the directors may determine) before the time of the 
poll.
Record holders of bp ADSs are also entitled to attend, speak and vote at 
any shareholders’ meeting of the company by the appointment by the 
approved depositary, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., of them as proxies in 
respect of the ordinary shares represented by their ADSs. Each such proxy 
may also appoint a proxy. Alternatively, holders of bp ADSs are entitled to 
vote by supplying their voting instructions to the Depositary, who will vote 
the ordinary shares represented by their ADSs in accordance with their 
instructions.
Proxies may be delivered electronically.
Corporations who are members of the company may appoint one or more 
persons to act as their representative or representatives at any 
shareholders’ meeting provided that the company may require a corporate 
representative to produce a certified copy of the resolution appointing them 
before they are permitted to exercise their powers.
Matters are transacted at shareholders’ meetings by the proposing and 
passing of resolutions, of which there are two types: ordinary or special.
An ordinary resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the 
votes cast at a meeting at which there is a quorum. A special resolution 
requires the affirmative vote of not less than three quarters of the votes 
cast at a meeting at which there is a quorum. Any AGM requires 21 clear 
days’ notice. The notice period for any other general meeting is 14 clear 
days subject to the company obtaining annual shareholder approval, failing 
which, a 21 clear day notice period will apply.
Liquidation rights; redemption provisions
In the event of a liquidation of bp, after payment of all liabilities and 
applicable deductions under UK laws and subject to the payment of 
secured creditors, the holders of bp preference shares would be entitled to 
the sum of (1) the capital paid up on such shares plus, (2) accrued and 
unpaid dividends and (3) a premium equal to the higher of (a) 10% of the 
capital paid up on the bp preference shares and (b) the excess of the 
average market price over par value of such shares on the London Stock 
Exchange during the previous six months. The remaining assets (if any) 
would be divided pro rata among the holders of ordinary shares.
Without prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders 
of any class of shares, bp may issue any share with such preferred, 
deferred or other special rights, or subject to such restrictions as the 
shareholders by resolution determine (or, in the absence of any such 
resolutions, by determination of the directors), and may issue shares that 
are to be or may be redeemed.
Variation of rights
The rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the consent 
in writing of holders of 75% of the shares of that class or on the adoption of 
a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the 
shares of that class. At every such separate meeting, all of the provisions of 
the Articles of Association relating to proceedings at a general meeting 
apply, except that the quorum with respect to a meeting to change the 
rights attached to the preference shares is 10% or more of the shares of 
that class, and the quorum to change the rights attached to the ordinary 
shares is one third or more of the shares of that class.
Shareholders’ meetings and notices
Shareholders must provide bp with a postal or electronic address in the UK 
to be entitled to receive notice of shareholders’ meetings. Holders of bp 
ADSs are entitled to receive notices under the terms of the deposit 
agreement relating to bp ADSs. The substance and timing of notices are 
described above under the heading Voting rights.
Under the Act, the AGM of shareholders must be held once every year, 
within each six-month period beginning with the day following the 
company’s accounting reference date. All general meetings shall be held at a time and place determined by the directors. If any shareholders’ meeting 
is adjourned for lack of quorum, notice of the time and place of the 
adjourned meeting may be given in any lawful manner, including 
electronically. Powers exist for action to be taken either before or at the 
meeting by authorized officers to ensure its orderly conduct and safety of 
those attending.
The directors have power to convene a general meeting which is a hybrid 
meeting, that is to provide facilities for shareholders to attend a meeting 
which is being held at a physical place by electronic means as well (but not 
to convene a purely electronic meeting).
The provisions of the Articles of Association in relation to satellite meetings 
permit facilities being provided by electronic means to allow those persons 
at each place to participate in the meeting.
Limitations on voting and shareholding
There are no limitations, either under the laws of the UK or under the 
company’s Articles of Association, restricting the right of non-resident or 
foreign owners to hold or vote bp ordinary or preference shares in the 
company other than limitations that would generally apply to all of the 
shareholders and limitations applicable to certain countries and persons 
subject to EU economic sanctions or those sanctions adopted by the UK 
government which implement resolutions of the Security Council of the 
United Nations.
Disclosure of interests in shares
The Act permits a public company to give notice to any person whom the 
company believes to be or, at any time during the three years prior to the 
issue of the notice, to have been interested in its voting shares requiring 
them to disclose certain information with respect to those interests. Failure 
to supply the information required may lead to disenfranchisement of the 
relevant shares and a prohibition on their transfer and receipt of dividends 
and other payments in respect of those shares and any new shares in the 
company issued in respect of those shares. In this context the term 
‘interest’ is widely defined and will generally include an interest of any kind 
whatsoever in voting shares, including any interest of a holder of bp ADSs.
Called-up share capital
Details of the allotted, called-up and fully-paid share capital at 31 December 
2024 are set out in Financial statements – Note 31. In accordance with 
institutional investor guidelines, the company deems it appropriate to grant 
authority to the directors to allot shares and other securities and to disapply 
pre-emption rights by way of shareholders' resolutions at each AGM in 
place of authority granted by virtue of the company's Articles of 
Association . At the AGM on 25 April 2024, authorization was given to the 
directors to allot shares in the company and to grant rights to subscribe for, 
or to convert any security into, shares in the company up to an aggregate 
nominal amount as set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting 2024 . 
These authorities were given for the period until the next AGM in 2025 or 25 
July 2025, whichever is the earlier. These authorities are renewed annually 
at the AGM.
Company records and service of notice
In relation to notices not covered by the Act, the reference to notice by 
advertisement in a national newspaper also includes advertisements via 
other means such as a public announcement.Shareholder information

Purchases of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchasers
During the 2024 financial year the company repurchased 1,238,335,234 ordinary shares with a nominal value of $0.25 each for a total consideration of 
$7,127,061,186 (including transaction costs), for the purpose of reducing the issued share capital of the company in order to return capital to shareholders 
and to offset the expected dilution from the vesting of awards under employee share schemes. The shares repurchased in 2024 represented 7.65% of the 
company’s issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury, on 31 December 2024. Of the shares repurchased in 2024, shares purchased under the 
2023 AGM authority represented 2.51%, and shares purchased under the 2024 AGM authority represented 5.14% of bp’s issued share capital, excluding 
shares held in treasury, on 31 December 2024. A further 176,152,257 ordinary shares were repurchased between the end of the financial year and 14 
February 2025 at a cost of $927,491,733 (including transaction costs) representing 1.09% of the company’s issued share capital, excluding shares held in 
treasury, on 31 December 2024. All ordinary shares repurchased in 2024 and in 2025 up to 14 February under the share buyback programmes were 
cancelled.
Authorization for the company to make market purchases (as defined in section 693(4) of the Companies Act 2006) of ordinary shares with a nominal 
value of $0.25 each in the company was renewed at the company’s 2024 AGM covering the period until the date of the company’s 2025 AGM or 25 July 
2025, whichever is earlier. The maximum number of ordinary shares to be purchased under this authority will not exceed 1,701,953,274 ordinary shares. 
The shares purchased will be cancelled.
The following table provides details of ordinary share purchases made (1) under the share buyback programmes and (2) by the Employee Share Ownership

Definitions
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the definitions for the following 
glossary terms are given below.
Non-IFRS measures are sometimes referred to as alternative performance 
measures. 
CA100+ resolution glossary
CA100+ resolution 
The CA100+ resolution means the special resolution requisitioned by 
Climate Action 100+ and passed at bp’s 2019 Annual General Meeting, the 
text of which is set out below.
Special resolution: Climate Action 100+ shareholder resolution on climate 
change disclosures
That in order to promote the long-term success of the company, given the 
recognized risks and opportunities associated with climate change, we as 
shareholders direct the company to include in its strategic report and/or 
other corporate reports, as appropriate, for the year ending 2019 onwards, a 
description of its strategy which the board considers, in good faith, to be 
consistent with the goals of Articles 2.1(a)(1) and 4.1(2) of the Paris 
Agreement (3) (the Paris goals), as well as:
(1) Capital expenditure: how the company evaluates the consistency of 
each new material capex investment, including in the exploration, 
acquisition or development of oil and gas resources and reserves and 
other energy sources and technologies, with (a) the Paris goals and 
separately (b) a range of other outcomes relevant to its strategy.
(2) Metrics and targets: the company’s principal metrics and relevant 
targets or goals over the short, medium and/or long term, consistent 
with the Paris goals, together with disclosure of:
a. The anticipated levels of investment in (i) oil and gas resources and 
reserves; and (ii) other energy sources and technologies.
b. The company’s targets to promote reductions in its operational 
greenhouse gas emissions, to be reviewed in line with changing 
protocols and other relevant factors. 
c. The estimated carbon intensity of the company’s energy products 
and progress on carbon intensity over time.
d. Any linkage between the above targets and executive remuneration. 
(3) Progress reporting: an annual review of progress against (1) and (2) 
above.
Such disclosure and reporting to include the criteria and summaries of the 
methodology and core assumptions used, and to omit commercially 
confidential or competitively sensitive information and be prepared at 
reasonable cost; and provided that nothing in this resolution shall limit the 
company’s powers to set and vary its strategy, or associated targets or 
metrics, or to take any action which it believes in good faith, would best 
promote the long-term success of the company.
The Paris goals 
(1) Article 2.1(a) of the Paris Agreement states the goal of ‘Holding the 
increase in the global average temperature to well-below-2°C above pre-
industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 
1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would 
significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change’.
(2) Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement: In order to achieve the long-term 
temperature goal set out in Article 2, parties aim to reach global peaking 
of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that 
peaking will take longer for developing country parties, and to undertake 
rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so 
as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources 
and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this 
century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable 
development and efforts to eradicate poverty. 
(3) U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties, 
Twenty-First Session, Adoption of the Paris Agreement, U.N. Doc. FCCC/
CP/2015/L.9/Rev.1 (Dec. 12, 2015).
New material capex investment
For the purposes of the 2024 evaluation discussed on pages 20-23, ‘new 
material capex investment’ means a decision taken by the resource commitment meeting (RCM) in 2024 to incur inorganic or organic 
investments greater than $250 million that relate to a new project or asset, 
extending an existing project or asset, or acquiring or increasing a share in 
a project, asset or entity.
Material capex evaluation: Paris-consistency quantitative tests.
For the purposes of evaluating material capex investments for consistency 
with the Paris goals, two quantitative tests were applied, see page 22.
Operational carbon intensity (CI)
The annual average operational GHG emissions (TeCO 2e/unit), divided by 
the relevant unit of output: 
•Per thousand barrels of oil equivalent in upstream.
•Per utilized equivalent distillation capacity in refining.
•per thousand tonnes of petrochemicals production.
Net zero aims and ambition glossary
Average carbon intensity of sold energy products
The rate of GHG emissions per unit of energy delivered (in grams CO 2e/MJ) 
estimated in respect of sold energy products «. GHG emissions are 
estimated on a lifecycle basis covering use, production, and distribution of 
sold energy products.
Emissions from the carbon in our upstream oil and gas 
production
Estimated CO 2 emissions from the combustion of upstream production of 
crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) based on bp’s net 
share of production, excluding bp’s share of Rosneft production and 
assuming that all produced volumes undergo full stoichiometric 
combustion to CO 2. 
Energy products
For the purposes of our 2024 disclosures relating to net zero sales « we 
consider an energy product to be one that is emissive or provides energy in 
its end use case. For further information on products included in bp’s 2024 
net zero sales aim reporting see the Basis of Reporting bp.com/
basisofreporting .
Methane intensity  
Methane intensity refers to the amount of methane emissions from bp’s 
operated upstream oil and gas assets as a percentage of the total gas that 
goes to market from those operations. Our methodology is aligned with the 
Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) methodology.
Net zero
References to global net zero in the phrase, 'to help the world get to net 
zero', means achieving '...a balance between anthropogenic emissions by 
sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases...on the basis of 
equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to 
eradicate poverty', as set out in Article 4(1) of the Paris Agreement.
References to net zero for bp in the context of our ambition and net zero 
operations and net zero sales aims mean achieving a balance between (a) 
the relevant Scope 1 and 2 emissions (for net zero operations) and product 
lifecycle emissions (for net zero sales) and (b) the aggregate of applicable 
deductions from qualifying activities such as sinks under our methodology 
at the applicable time.
Net zero « operations
bp’s aim to reach net zero operational greenhouse gas (CO 2 and methane) 
emissions by 2050 or sooner, on a gross operational control basis, in 
accordance with bp’s net zero operations aim, which relates to our reported 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Any interim target or aim in respect of bp’s net 
zero operations aim is defined in terms of absolute reductions relative to 
the baseline year of 2019.
Net zero « production
In relation to bp’s now retired (as of February 2025) ‘aim 2’, to reach net 
zero CO 2 emissions from the carbon in our upstream oil and gas 
production, in respect of the estimated CO 2 emissions from the combustion 
of upstream production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids 
(based on bp’s net share of production, excluding bp’s share of Rosneft 
production and assuming that all produced volumes undergo full 
stoichiometric combustion to CO 2). This aim previously related to Scope 3 
352 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

category 11 emissions within the selected boundary of bp’s net share of 
upstream production of oil and gas.
Net zero « sales
bp's aim to reach net zero for the carbon intensity of sold energy 
products«. Any interim target or aim in respect of bp’s net zero sales aim 
is defined in terms of reductions in the carbon intensity of the energy 
products we sell (in grams CO 2e/MJ) relative to the baseline year of 2019.
Sold energy products
For the purposes of bp’s net zero sales aim, sold energy products « 
represent sales by a bp group subsidiary, joint operation or bp equity 
accounted entity (EAE). For further information see the Basis of Reporting 
bp.com/basisofreporting .
Adjusted EBIDA 
Adjusted EBIDA is a non-IFRS measure and is defined as profit or loss for 
the period, adjusting for finance costs and net finance (income) or expense 
relating to pensions and other post-employment benefits and taxation, 
inventory holding gains or losses before tax, net adjusting items « before 
interest and tax, and taxation on an underlying RC basis, and adding back 
depreciation, depletion and amortization (pre-tax) and exploration 
expenditure written-off (net of adjusting items, pre-tax). bp believes that 
adjusted EBIDA is a useful measure for investors because it is a measure 
closely tracked by management to evaluate bp’s operating performance 
and to make financial, strategic and operating decisions and because it 
may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as 
management, the underlying trends in bp’s operational performance on a 
comparable basis, period on period. The nearest equivalent measure on an 
IFRS basis is profit or loss for the period. A reconciliation of profit or loss 
for the period to adjusted EBIDA is provided on page 361.
Adjusted EBIDA per share compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
Non-IFRS measure. Adjusted EBIDA per share is calculated based on the 
shares in issue at period end.
Adjusted EBITDA  
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure presented for bp's operating 
segments and the group. Adjusted EBITDA for bp's operating segments is 
defined as replacement cost (RC) profit before interest and tax, excluding 
net adjusting items before interest and tax, and adding back depreciation, 
depletion and amortization and exploration write-offs (net of adjusting 
items). Adjusted EBITDA by business is a further analysis of adjusted 
EBITDA for the customers & products businesses. bp believes it is helpful 
to disclose adjusted EBITDA by operating segment and by business 
because it reflects how the segments measure underlying business 
delivery. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for the segment 
is RC profit or loss before interest and tax, which is bp's measure of profit 
or loss that is required to be disclosed for each operating segment under 
IFRS. A reconciliation to IFRS information is provided on pages 327 and 
362.
Adjusted EBITDA for the group is defined as profit or loss for the period, 
adjusting for finance costs and net finance (income) or expense relating to 
pensions and other post-employment benefits and taxation, inventory 
holding gains or losses before tax, net adjusting items before interest and 
tax, and adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization (pre-tax) and 
exploration expenditure written-off (net of adjusting items, pre-tax). The 
nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for the group is profit or loss 
for the period. A reconciliation to IFRS information is provided on page 362.
Adjusted  free  cash  flow
Non-IFRS measure. It is defined as adjusted operating cash flow « (see 
below) less capital expenditure «.
bp believes the measure provides useful information to investors. Adjusted 
free cash flow enables investors to measure our progress on delivering 
growth and improving our performance. The nearest IFRS measures are net 
cash provided by (used in) operating activities and total cash capital 
expenditure. 
We are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for 
adjusted free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, 
because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately 
certain adjusting items required to present a meaningful comparable IFRS forward-looking financial measure. These items include inventory holding 
gains or losses, fair value accounting effects and other adjusting items, that 
are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in an IFRS estimate.
Adjusted free cash flow compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
Non-IFRS measure. It is annualized growth rate of adjusted free cash 
flow« (defined above) at $70/bbl Brent, $4/mmBtu Henry Hub, and $17/
bbl refining marker margin, all 2024 real.
bp believes the measure provides useful information to investors. Adjusted 
free cash flow CAGR enables investors to measure our progress on 
delivering growth and improving our performance. The nearest IFRS 
measure is the annualized growth rate of net cash provided by (used in) 
operating activities. 
We are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for 
adjusted free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, 
because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately 
certain adjusting items required to present a meaningful comparable IFRS 
forward-looking financial measure. These items include inventory holding 
gains or losses, fair value accounting effects and other adjusting items, that 
are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in an IFRS estimate.
Adjusted  operating  cash  flow
Non-IFRS measure. It is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating 
activities as presented in the group cash flow statement, excluding 
movements in inventories and other current and non-current assets and 
liabilities as presented in the group cash flow statement, adjusted for 
inventory holding gains/losses, fair value accounting effects (FVAEs) 
relating to subsidiaries and other adjusting items relating to the non-cash 
movement of US emissions obligations carried as a provision that will be 
settled by allowances held as inventory. When used in the context of a 
segment or subset of businesses rather than the group, the terms refer to 
the segment or business' estimated share thereof.
bp believes the measure provides useful information to investors. Adjusted 
operating cash flow enables investors to measure our progress on 
delivering growth and improving our performance. The nearest IFRS 
measure is net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. 
We are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for 
adjusted operating cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, 
because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately 
certain adjusting items required to present a meaningful comparable IFRS 
forward-looking financial measure. These items include inventory holding 
gains or losses, FVAEs and other adjusting items, that are difficult to predict 
in advance in order to include in an IFRS estimate.
Adjusting  items  
Adjusting items are items that bp discloses separately because it considers 
such disclosures to be meaningful and relevant to investors. They are items 
that management considers to be important to period-on-period analysis of 
the group's results and are disclosed in order to enable investors to better 
understand and evaluate the group’s reported financial performance. 
Adjusting items include gains and losses on the sale of businesses and 
fixed assets, impairments, environmental and related provisions and 
charges, restructuring, integration and rationalization costs, fair value 
accounting effects, costs relating to the Gulf of America oil spill and other 
items. Adjusting items within equity-accounted earnings are reported net of 
incremental income tax reported by the equity-accounted entity. Adjusting 
items are used as a reconciling adjustment to derive underlying RC profit or 
loss and related underlying measures which are non-IFRS measures. An 
analysis of adjusting items by segment and type is shown on page 313.
Associate
An entity over which the group has significant influence and that is neither a 
subsidiary nor a joint arrangement of the group. Significant influence is the 
power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the 
investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
Biofuels  production
Biofuels production is average thousands of barrels of biofuel production 
per day during the period covered net to bp. This includes equivalent 
ethanol production, bp bioenergy biopower for grid export, refining co-
processing and standalone hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO). Glossary
« See glossary on page 351 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 353

Biogas  supply  volumes
Biogas supply volumes is the average thousands of barrels of oil equivalent 
per day of production and offtakes during the period covered net to bp.
Bio-refinery
A facility that is dedicated to processing biological materials (including 
waste oil and crop waste) to produce biofuels such as biodiesel and 
sustainable aviation fuel, which may be blended to customer specifications 
with other components such as hydrocarbons at co-located or adjacent 
terminals and tanks.
Blue  hydrogen
Hydrogen made from natural gas in combination with carbon captured and 
stored (CCS).
Capital  employed  
Non-IFRS measure. It is defined as total equity plus finance debt.
Capital  expenditure
Total cash capital expenditure as stated in the group cash flow statement. 
Capital expenditure for the operating segments, gas & low carbon energy 
businesses and customers & products businesses is presented on the 
same basis.
Cash  balance  point
Cash balance point is defined as the implied Brent oil price 2021 real to 
balance bp’s sources and uses of cash assuming an average bp refining 
marker margin around $11/bbl and Henry Hub at $3/mmBtu in 2021 real 
terms. 
Commodity  trading  contracts
bp participates in regional and global commodity trading markets in order 
to manage, transact and hedge the crude oil, refined products and natural 
gas that the group either produces or consumes in its manufacturing 
operations. The range of contracts the group enters into in its commodity 
trading operations is described below. Using these contracts, in 
combination with rights to access storage and transportation capacity, 
allows the group to access advantageous pricing differences between 
locations, time periods and grades.
Exchange-traded  commodity  derivatives
Contracts that are typically in the form of futures and options traded on a 
recognized exchange, such as Nymex and ICE. Such contracts are traded in 
standard specifications for the main marker crude oils, such as Brent and 
West Texas Intermediate; the main product grades, such as gasoline and 
gasoil; and for natural gas and power. Gains and losses, otherwise referred 
to as variation margin, are generally settled on a daily basis with the 
relevant exchange. These contracts are used for the trading and risk 
management of crude oil, refined products, and natural gas and power. 
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on exchange-traded commodity 
derivatives are included in sales and other operating revenues for 
accounting purposes.
Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts 
Contracts that are typically in the form of forwards, swaps and options. 
Some of these contracts are traded bilaterally between counterparties or 
through brokers, others may be cleared by a central clearing counterparty. 
These contracts can be used both for trading and risk management 
activities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on OTC contracts are 
included in sales and other operating revenues for accounting purposes. 
Many grades of crude oil bought and sold use standard contracts including 
US domestic light sweet crude oil, commonly referred to as West Texas 
Intermediate, and a standard North Sea crude blend – Brent, Forties, 
Oseberg and Ekofisk (BFOE). Forward contracts are used in connection 
with the purchase of crude oil supplies for refineries and for marketing and 
sales of the group’s oil production and refined products. The contracts 
typically contain standard delivery and settlement terms. These 
transactions call for physical delivery of oil with consequent operational and 
price risk. However, various means exist and are used from time to time, to 
settle obligations under the contracts in cash rather than through physical 
delivery. Physically settled BFOE contracts delivered by cargo additionally 
specify a standard volume and tolerance.
Gas and power OTC markets are highly developed in North America and the 
UK, where commodities can be bought and sold for delivery in future periods. These contracts are negotiated between two parties to purchase 
and sell gas and power at a specified price, with delivery and settlement at 
a future date. Typically, the contracts specify delivery terms for the 
underlying commodity. Some of these transactions are not settled 
physically as they can be net settled by transacting offsetting sale or 
purchase contracts for the same location and delivery period. The 
contracts contain standard terms such as delivery point, pricing 
mechanism, settlement terms and specification of the commodity. 
Typically, volume, price and term (e.g. daily, monthly and balance of month) 
are the main variable contract terms.
Swaps are typically contractual obligations to exchange cash flows 
between two parties. A typical swap transaction usually references a 
floating price and a fixed price with the net difference of the cash flows 
being settled. Options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy 
or sell crude, oil products, natural gas or power at a specified price on or 
before a specific future date. Amounts under these derivative financial 
instruments are settled at expiry. Typically, netting agreements are used to 
limit credit exposure and support liquidity.
Spot  and term  contracts  
Spot contracts are contracts to purchase or sell a commodity at the market 
price prevailing on or around the delivery date when title to the inventory is 
taken. Term contracts are contracts to purchase or sell a commodity at 
regular intervals over an agreed term. Though spot and term contracts may 
have a standard form, there is no offsetting mechanism in place. As such, 
these transactions result in physical delivery with operational and price risk. 
Spot and term contracts typically relate to purchases of crude for a refinery, 
products for marketing, or third-party natural gas, or sales of the group’s oil 
production, oil products or gas production to third parties. For accounting 
purposes, spot and term sales are included in sales and other operating 
revenues when title passes. Similarly, spot and term purchases are included 
in purchases for accounting purposes.
Consolidation  adjustment – UPII
Unrealized profit in inventory arising on inter-segment transactions.
Convenience  gross  margin
Non-IFRS measure. Convenience gross margin is calculated as RC profit 
before interest and tax for the customers & products segment, excluding 
RC profit before interest and tax for the refining & trading business (a non-
IFRS measure), and adjusting items « (as defined above) for the 
convenience & mobility business to derive underlying RC profit before 
interest and tax for the convenience & mobility business; subtracting 
underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the Castrol  business; adding 
back depreciation, depletion and amortization, production and 
manufacturing, distribution and administration expenses for convenience & 
mobility (excluding Castrol ); subtracting earnings from equity-accounted 
entities in the convenience & mobility business (excluding Castrol ) and 
gross margin for the retail fuels, EV charging, aviation, B2B and midstream 
businesses. bp believes it is helpful because this measure may help 
investors to understand and evaluate, in the same way as management, our 
progress against our strategic objectives of convenience growth. The 
nearest IFRS measure is RC profit before interest and tax for the customers 
& products segment. 
Convenience  gross  margin  growth
Non-IFRS measure. See convenience gross margin definition above. 
Convenience gross margin growth at constant foreign exchange is a non-
IFRS measure. This metric requires a calculation of the comparative 
convenience gross margin ($ million) at current period foreign exchange 
rates (constant foreign exchange) and compares the current period value 
with the restated comparative period value, which results in the growth % at 
constant foreign exchange rates. bp believes the convenience gross margin 
growth at constant foreign exchange are useful measures because these 
measures may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same way 
as management, our progress against our strategic objectives of redefining 
convenience. The nearest IFRS measure to convenience gross margin is RC 
profit before interest and tax for the customer & products segment. 
Convenience & EV gross margin growth (%)
Non-IFRS measure. See convenience gross margin and EV gross margin 
definitions. Convenience and EV gross margin growth at constant foreign 
exchange is a non-IFRS measure. This metric, as applicable to the directors’ 
remuneration performance measure, requires a calculation of the 
354 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

comparative convenience and EV gross margin ($ million) at current period 
foreign exchange rates (constant foreign exchange) and compares the 
current period value with the restated comparative period value, which 
results in the growth % at constant foreign exchange rates. The nearest 
IFRS measure to convenience gross margin and EV gross margin is RC 
profit before interest and tax for the customer & products segment.
Developed  renewables  to final  investment  decision (FID)
Total generating capacity for assets developed to FID by all entities where 
bp has an equity share (proportionate to equity share). If asset is 
subsequently sold bp will continue to record capacity as developed to FID. 
If bp equity share increases developed capacity to FID will increase 
proportionately to share increase for any assets where bp held equity at the 
point of FID.
Divestment  proceeds
Disposal proceeds as per the group cash flow statement.
Dividend  yield
Sum of the four quarterly dividends announced in respect of the year as a 
percentage of the year-end share price.
Dutch  Title Transfer  Facility
The TTF (Title Transfer Facility) is the virtual trading point for natural gas in 
the Netherlands. It is commonly used as a benchmark hub for gas prices in 
Europe.
Effective  tax rate (ETR)  on replacement  cost (RC) profit  or loss
Non-IFRS measure. The ETR on RC profit or loss is calculated by dividing 
taxation on a RC basis by RC profit or loss before tax. Taxation on a RC 
basis for the group is calculated as taxation as stated on the group income 
statement adjusted for taxation on inventory holding gains and losses. 
Information on RC profit or loss is provided below. bp believes it is helpful 
to disclose the ETR on RC profit or loss because this measure excludes the 
impact of price changes on the replacement of inventories and allows for 
more meaningful comparisons between reporting periods. Taxation on a 
RC basis and ETR on RC profit or loss are non-IFRS measures. The nearest 
equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is the ETR on profit or loss for the 
period. A reconciliation to IFRS information is provided on page 360.
Electric vehicle charge points / EV charge points  
Defined as the number of connectors on a charging device, operated by 
either bp or a bp joint venture, as adjusted to be reflective of bp’s 
accounting share of joint arrangements. 
EV gross margin 
Non-IFRS measure. EV gross margin, as applicable to the directors’ 
remuneration performance measure, is calculated as RC profit before 
interest and tax for the customers & products segment, excluding RC profit 
before interest and tax for the refining & trading business (a non-IFRS 
measure), and adjusting items « (as defined above) for the convenience & 
mobility business to derive underlying RC profit before interest and tax for 
the convenience & mobility business; subtracting underlying RC profit 
before interest and tax for the Castrol  business; adding back depreciation, 
depletion and amortization, production and manufacturing, distribution and 
administration expenses for convenience & mobility (excluding Castrol ); 
subtracting earnings from equity-accounted entities in the convenience & 
mobility business (excluding Castrol ) and gross margin for the convenience 
and retail fuels, aviation, B2B and midstream businesses. The nearest IFRS 
measure to EV gross margin is RC profit before interest and tax for the 
customer & products segment.
Fair value accounting effects  
Non-IFRS adjustments to our IFRS profit (loss).They reflect the difference 
between the way bp manages the economic exposure and internally 
measures performance of certain activities and the way those activities are 
measured under IFRS. Fair value accounting effects are included within 
adjusting items. They relate to certain of the group's commodity, interest 
rate and currency risk exposures as detailed below. Other than as noted 
below, the fair value accounting effects described are reported in both the 
gas & low carbon energy and customer & products segments. 
bp uses derivative instruments to manage the economic exposure relating 
to inventories above normal operating requirements of crude oil, natural 
gas and petroleum products. Under IFRS, these inventories are recorded at historical cost. The related derivative instruments, however, are required to 
be recorded at fair value with gains and losses recognized in the income 
statement. This is because hedge accounting is either not permitted or not 
followed, principally due to the impracticality of effectiveness-testing 
requirements. Therefore, measurement differences in relation to 
recognition of gains and losses occur. Gains and losses on these 
inventories, other than net realizable value provisions, are not recognized 
until the commodity is sold in a subsequent accounting period. Gains and 
losses on the related derivative commodity contracts are recognized in the 
income statement, from the time the derivative commodity contract is 
entered into, on a fair value basis using forward prices consistent with the 
contract maturity.
bp enters into physical commodity contracts to meet certain business 
requirements, such as the purchase of crude for a refinery or the sale of 
bp’s gas production. Under IFRS these physical contracts are treated as 
derivatives and are required to be fair valued when they are managed as 
part of a larger portfolio of similar transactions. Gains and losses arising 
are recognized in the income statement from the time the derivative 
commodity contract is entered into. 
IFRS require that inventory held for trading is recorded at its fair value using 
period-end spot prices, whereas any related derivative commodity 
instruments are required to be recorded at values based on forward prices 
consistent with the contract maturity. Depending on market conditions, 
these forward prices can be either higher or lower than spot prices, 
resulting in measurement differences. 
bp enters into contracts for pipelines and other transportation, storage 
capacity, oil and gas processing, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and certain gas 
and power contracts that, under IFRS, are recorded on an accruals basis. 
These contracts are risk-managed using a variety of derivative instruments 
that are fair valued under IFRS. This results in measurement differences in 
relation to recognition of gains and losses. 
The way that bp manages the economic exposures described above, and 
measures performance internally, differs from the way these activities are 
measured under IFRS. bp calculates this difference for consolidated entities 
by comparing the IFRS result with management’s internal measure of 
performance. We believe that disclosing management’s estimate of this 
difference provides useful information for investors because it enables 
investors to see the economic effect of these activities as a whole. 
These include:
•Under management’s internal measure of performance the inventory, 
transportation and capacity contracts in question are valued based on 
fair value using relevant forward prices prevailing at the end of the 
period. 
•Fair value accounting effects also include changes in the fair value of 
the near-term portions of LNG contracts that fall within bp’s risk 
management framework. LNG contracts are not considered derivatives, 
because there is insufficient market liquidity, and they are therefore 
accrual accounted under IFRS. However, oil and natural gas derivative 
financial instruments used to risk manage the near-term portions of the 
LNG contracts are fair valued under IFRS. The fair value accounting 
effect, which is reported in the gas and low carbon energy segment, 
represents the change in value of LNG contracts that are being risk 
managed and which is reflected in the underlying result, but not in 
reported earnings. Management believes that this gives a better 
representation of performance in each period. 
Furthermore, the fair values of derivative instruments used to risk manage 
certain other oil, gas, power and other contracts, are deferred to match with 
the underlying exposure. The commodity contracts for business 
requirements are accounted for on an accruals basis. 
In addition, fair value accounting effects include changes in the fair value of 
derivatives entered into by the group to manage currency exposure and 
interest rate risks relating to hybrid bonds to their respective first call 
periods. The hybrid bonds which are classified as equity instruments and 
were recorded in the balance sheet at their issuance date at their USD 
equivalent issued value. Under IFRS these equity instruments are not 
remeasured from period to period, and do not qualify for application of 
hedge accounting. The derivative instruments relating to the hybrid bonds, 
however, are required to be recorded at fair value with mark to market gains 
and losses recognized in the income statement. Therefore, measurement Glossary
« See glossary on page 351 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 355

differences in relation to the recognition of gains and losses occur. The fair 
value accounting effect, which is reported in the other businesses & 
corporate segment, eliminates the fair value gains and losses of these 
derivative financial instruments that are recognized in the income 
statement. We believe that this gives a better representation of 
performance, by more appropriately reflecting the economic effect of these 
risk management activities, in each period. 
Fast / Fast charging
Fast charging comprises rapid charging « and ultra-fast charging «.
Finance debt ratio
Finance debt ratio is defined as the ratio of finance debt to the total of 
finance debt plus total equity.
Gearing and net debt
Non-IFRS measures. Net debt is calculated as finance debt, as shown in the 
balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial 
instruments that are used to hedge foreign currency exchange and interest 
rate risks relating to finance debt, for which hedge accounting is applied, 
less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt does not include accrued interest, 
which is reported within other receivables and other payables on the 
balance sheet and for which the associated cash flows are presented as 
operating cash flows in the group cash flow statement. Gearing is defined 
as the ratio of net debt to the total of net debt plus total equity. bp believes 
these measures provide useful information to investors. Net debt enables 
investors to see the economic effect of finance debt, related hedges and 
cash and cash equivalents in total. Gearing enables investors to see how 
significant net debt is relative to total equity. The derivatives are reported on 
the balance sheet within the headings ‘Derivative financial instruments’. See 
Financial statements – Note 27 for information on finance debt, which is 
the nearest equivalent measure to net debt on an IFRS basis. The nearest 
equivalent IFRS measure to gearing on an IFRS basis is finance debt ratio.
We are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for 
net debt or gearing to finance debt and total equity, because without 
unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting 
items required to present a meaningful comparable IFRS forward-looking 
financial measure. These items include fair value asset (liability) of hedges 
related to finance debt and cash and cash equivalents, that are difficult to 
predict in advance in order to include in an IFRS estimate.
Gearing including leases and net debt including leases
Non-IFRS measures. Net debt including leases is calculated as net debt 
plus lease liabilities, less the net amount of partner receivables and 
payables relating to leases entered into on behalf of joint operations. 
Gearing including leases is defined as the ratio of net debt including leases 
to the total of net debt including leases plus total equity. bp believes these 
measures provide useful information to investors as they enable investors 
to understand the impact of the group’s lease portfolio on net debt and 
gearing. See Financial statements – Note 27 for information on finance 
debt, which is the nearest equivalent measure to net debt including leases 
on an IFRS basis. The nearest equivalent IFRS measure to gearing including 
leases on an IFRS basis is finance debt ratio. A reconciliation to IFRS 
information is provided on page 315.
Green hydrogen
Hydrogen produced by electrolysis of water using renewable power.
Grey hydrogen
Produced via natural gas or coal without CCUS.
Hydrocarbons
Liquids and natural gas. Natural gas is converted to oil equivalent at 
5.8 billion cubic feet = 1 million barrels.
Hydrogen pipeline
Hydrogen projects which have not been developed to final investment 
decision (FID) but which have advanced to the concept development stage.
Inorganic capital expenditure
A subset of capital expenditure on a cash basis and a non-IFRS measure. 
Inorganic capital expenditure comprises consideration in business 
combinations and certain other significant investments made by the group. 
It is reported on a cash basis. bp believes that this measure provides useful 
information as it allows investors to understand how bp’s management invests funds in projects which expand the group’s activities through 
acquisition. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is capital 
expenditure on a cash basis. Further information and a reconciliation to 
IFRS information is provided on page 312.
Installed renewables capacity
Installed renewables capacity is bp's share of capacity for operating assets 
owned by entities where bp has an equity share.
Inventory holding gains and losses
Inventory holding gains and losses are non-IFRS adjustments to our IFRS 
profit (loss) and represent:
•The difference between the cost of sales calculated using the 
replacement cost of inventory and the cost of sales calculated on the 
first-in first-out (FIFO) method after adjusting for any changes in 
provisions where the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than 
its cost. Under the FIFO method, which we use for IFRS reporting of 
inventories other than for trading inventories, the cost of inventory 
charged to the income statement is based on its historical cost of 
purchase or manufacture, rather than its replacement cost. In volatile 
energy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on reported 
income. The amounts disclosed as inventory holding gains and losses 
represent the difference between the charge to the income statement 
for inventory on a FIFO basis (after adjusting for any related movements 
in net realizable value provisions) and the charge that would have arisen 
based on the replacement cost of inventory. For this purpose, the 
replacement cost of inventory is calculated using data from each 
operation’s production and manufacturing system, either on a monthly 
basis, or separately for each transaction where the system allows this 
approach. 
•An adjustment relating to certain trading inventories that are not price 
risk managed which relate to a minimum inventory volume that is 
required to be held to maintain underlying business activities. This 
adjustment represents the movement in fair value of the inventories due 
to prices, on a grade-by-grade basis, during the period. This is calculated 
from each operation’s inventory management system on a monthly 
basis using the discrete monthly movement in market prices for these 
inventories. 
The amounts disclosed are not separately reflected in the financial 
statements as a gain or loss. No adjustment is made in respect of the cost 
of inventories held as part of a trading position and certain other temporary 
inventory positions that are price risk-managed. See Replacement cost (RC) 
profit or loss definition below.
Joint arrangement
An arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control.
Joint control
Contractually agreed sharing of control over an arrangement, which exists 
only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control.
Joint operation
A joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the 
arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, 
relating to the arrangement.
Joint venture
A joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the 
arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
Liquids

LNG portfolio refers to bp group’s LNG equity production plus additional 
long-term merchant LNG volumes.
LNG train
An LNG train is a processing facility used to liquefy and purify natural gas in 
the formation of LNG.
356 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

Low carbon activity 
For the purposes of FY24 and FY23 reporting an activity relating to low 
carbon including: renewable electricity; bioenergy; electric vehicles and 
other future mobility solutions; trading and marketing low carbon products; 
blue or green hydrogen « and carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS). 
Note that, while there is some overlap of activities, these terms do not 
mean the same as low carbon energy or our low carbon energy sub-
segment, reported within the gas & low carbon energy segment.
Low carbon activity investment  
Capital investment in relation to low carbon activity «.
Major projects
Have a bp net investment of at least $250 million, or are considered to be of 
strategic importance to bp or of a high degree of complexity. 
Modified  free  cash  flow  
A non-IFRS measure. It is defined as Operating cash flow less: (1) net cash 
used in investing activities as presented in the group cash flow statement; 
and (2) lease liability payments included in financing activities and adjusting 
for receipts relating to transactions involving non-controlling interests 
reported within financing activities in the group cash flow statement and 
movements in lease creditor.
Operating cash flow
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as stated in the group 
cash flow statement. When used in the context of a segment rather than 
the group, the terms refer to the segment’s share thereof.
Operating expenditure
Non IFRS measure and a subset of production and manufacturing 
expenses plus distribution and administration expenses. It represents the 
majority of the remaining expenses in these line items but excludes certain 
costs that are variable, primarily with volumes (such as freight costs). Other 
variable costs are included in purchases in the income statement. 
Management believes that operating expenditure is a performance 
measure that provides investors with useful information regarding the 
company’s financial performance because it considers these expenses to 
be the principal operating and overhead expenses that are most directly 
under their control although they also include certain adjusting items «, 
foreign exchange and commodity price effects. The nearest IFRS measures 
are production and manufacturing expenses and distributions and 
administration expenses. A reconciliation of production and manufacturing 
expense plus distribution and administration expenses to operating 
expenditure is provided on page 363. 
Operating management system (OMS)
bp’s OMS helps us manage risks in our operating activities by setting out 
bp’s principles for good operating practice. It brings together bp 
requirements on health, safety, security, the environment, social 
responsibility and operational reliability, as well as related issues, such as 
maintenance, contractor relations and organizational learning, into a 
common management system.
Organic capital expenditure
Non-IFRS measure. Organic capital expenditure comprises capital 
expenditure on a cash basis less inorganic capital expenditure. bp believes 
that this measure provides useful information as it allows investors to 
understand how bp’s management invests funds in developing and 
maintaining the group’s assets. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS 
basis is capital expenditure on a cash basis. An analysis of organic capital 
expenditure by segment and region, and a reconciliation to IFRS 
information is provided on page 312.
We are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for 
organic capital expenditure to total cash capital expenditure, because 
without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately the 
adjusting item, inorganic capital expenditure, that is difficult to predict in 
advance in order to derive the nearest IFRS estimate.Production-sharing agreement / contract (PSA / PSC)  
An arrangement through which an oil and gas company bears the risks and 
costs of exploration, development and production. In return, if exploration is 
successful, the oil company receives entitlement to variable physical 
volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a 
stipulated share of the production remaining after such cost recovery.
Rapid / Rapid charging  
Rapid charging includes electric vehicle charging of greater or equal to 
50kW and less than 150kW. 
Realizations
Realizations are the result of dividing revenue generated from hydrocarbon 
sales, excluding revenue generated from purchases made for resale and 
royalty volumes, by revenue generating hydrocarbon production volumes. 
Revenue generating hydrocarbon production reflects the bp share of 
production as adjusted for any production which does not generate 
revenue. Adjustments may include losses due to shrinkage, amounts 
consumed during processing, and contractual or regulatory host 
committed volumes such as royalties. For the gas & low carbon energy and 
oil production & operations segments, realizations include transfers 
between businesses.
Refining availability
Represents Solomon Associates’ operational availability for bp-operated 
refineries, which is defined as the percentage of the year that a unit is 
available for processing after subtracting the annualized time lost due to 
turnaround activity and all mechanical, process and regulatory downtime.
Refining marker margin (RMM)
The average of regional indicator margins weighted for bp’s crude refining 
capacity in each region. Each regional marker margin is based on product 
yields and a marker crude oil deemed appropriate for the region. The 
regional indicator margins may not be representative of the margins 
achieved by bp in any period because of bp’s particular refinery 
configurations and crude and product slate.
Replacement cost (RC) profit or loss / RC profit or loss 
attributable to bp shareholders  
Reflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is 
calculated as profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders, adjusting for 
inventory holding gains and losses (net of tax). RC profit or loss for the 
group is not a recognized IFRS measure. bp believes this measure is useful 
to illustrate to investors the fact that crude oil and product prices can vary 
significantly from period to period and that the impact on our reported 
result under IFRS can be significant. Inventory holding gains and losses 
vary from period to period due to changes in prices as well as changes in 
underlying inventory levels. In order for investors to understand the 
operating performance of the group excluding the impact of price changes 
on the replacement of inventories, and to make comparisons of operating 
performance between reporting periods, bp’s management believes it is 
helpful to disclose this measure. The nearest equivalent measure on an 
IFRS basis is profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders. See Financial 
statements – Note 5. A reconciliation to IFRS information is provided on 
page 360.
Reported recordable injury frequency
Reported recordable injury frequency measures the number of reported 
work-related employee and contractor incidents that result in a fatality or 
injury per 200,000 hours worked. This represents reported incidents 
occurring within bp’s operational HSSE reporting boundary. That boundary 
includes bp’s own operated facilities and certain other locations or 
situations.
Renewable natural gas (RNG)
RNG is a pipeline-quality, lower carbon fuel that is interchangeable with 
traditional natural gas. It is a form of biogas and a product of decomposing 
organic material at sites including landfills, farms and wastewater 
treatment facilities.Glossary
« See glossary on page 351 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 357

Renewables pipeline
Renewable projects satisfying the criteria below until the point they can be 
considered developed to FID: 
Site-based projects that have obtained land exclusivity rights, or for power 
purchase agreement based projects an offer has been made to the 
counterparty, or for auction projects pre-qualification criteria have been 
met, or for acquisition projects post a binding offer has been accepted.
Reserves replacement ratio
The extent to which the year’s production has been replaced by proved 
reserves added to our reserve base. The ratio is expressed in oil-equivalent 
terms and includes changes resulting from discoveries, improved recovery 
and extensions and revisions to previous estimates, but excludes changes 
resulting from acquisitions and disposals.
Retail sites
Retail sites include sites operated by dealers, jobbers, franchisees or brand 
licensees or joint venture (JV) partners, under the bp brand. These may 
move to and from the bp brand as their fuel supply agreement or brand 
licence agreement expires and are renegotiated in the normal course of 
business. Retail sites are primarily branded BP, ARCO, Amoco , Aral , 
Thorntons , and TravelCenters of America and also includes sites in India 
through our Jio-bp JV.
Return on average capital employed (ROACE)
Non-IFRS measure. ROACE is defined as underlying replacement cost 
profit, which is defined as profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders 
adjusted for inventory holding gains and losses, adjusting items and related 
taxation on inventory holding gains and losses and adjusting items total 
taxation, after adding back non-controlling interest and interest expense net 
of tax, divided by the average of the beginning and ending balances of total 
equity plus finance debt, excluding cash and cash equivalents and goodwill 
as presented on the group balance sheet over the periods presented. 
Interest expense before tax is finance costs as presented on the group 
income statement, excluding lease interest, the unwinding of the discount 
on provisions and other payables and other adjusting items reported in 
finance costs. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the ROACE because this 
measure gives an indication of the company's capital efficiency. The 
nearest IFRS measures of the numerator and denominator are profit or loss 
for the period attributable to bp shareholders and total equity respectively. 
The reconciliation of the numerator and denominator is provided on page 
361.
We are unable to present forward-looking information of the nearest IFRS 
measures of the numerator and denominator for ROACE, because without 
unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting 
items required to calculate a meaningful comparable IFRS forward-looking 
financial measure. These items include inventory holding gains or losses 
and interest net of tax, that are difficult to predict in advance in order to 
include in an IFRS estimate.
Strategic convenience sites
Strategic convenience sites are retail sites, within the bp portfolio, which 
sell bp-supplied vehicle energy (e.g. BP, Aral , Arco, Amoco , Thorntons , bp 
pulse , TravelCenters of America and PETRO ) and either carry one of the 
strategic convenience brands (e.g. M&S, Rewe to Go) or a differentiated bp-
controlled convenience offer. To be considered a strategic convenience 
site, the convenience offer should have a demonstrable level of 
differentiation in the market in which it operates. Strategic convenience site 
count includes sites under a pilot phase.
Structural cost reduction
Non-IFRS measure. It is calculated as decreases in underlying operating 
expenditure « (as defined below) as a result of operational efficiencies, 
divestments, workforce reductions and other cost saving measures that are 
expected to be sustainable compared with 2023 levels. The total change 
between periods in underlying operating expenditure will reflect both 
structural cost reductions and other changes in spend, including market 
factors, such as inflation and foreign exchange impacts, as well as changes 
in activity levels and costs associated with new operations. Estimates of 
cumulative annual structural cost reduction may be revised depending on 
whether cost reductions realized in prior periods are determined to be 
sustainable compared with 2023 levels. Structural cost reductions are stewarded internally to support management’s oversight of spending over 
time.
bp believes this performance measure is useful in demonstrating how 
management drives cost discipline across the entire organization, 
simplifying our processes and portfolio and streamlining the way we work. 
The nearest IFRS measures are production and manufacturing expenses 
and distributions and administration expenses. A reconciliation of 
production and manufacturing expenses plus distribution and 
administration expenses to underlying operating expenditure is provided on 
page 363.
We are unable to present forward-looking information of the nearest IFRS 
measures, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast 
accurately certain adjusting items required to calculate a meaningful 
comparable IFRS forward-looking financial measure. 
Subsidiary
An entity that is controlled by the bp group. Control of an investee exists 
when an investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the investee.
Surplus cash flow
Surplus cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for 
discretionary expenditures. It is a non-IFRS financial measure that should 
be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash 
provided by operating activities, reported in accordance with IFRS.  
Surplus cash flow refers to the net surplus of sources of cash over uses of 
cash. Sources of cash include net cash provided by operating activities, 
cash provided from investing activities and cash receipts relating to 
transactions involving non-controlling interests. Uses of cash include lease 
liability payments, payments on perpetual hybrid bonds, dividends paid, 
cash capital expenditure, the cash cost of share buybacks to offset the 
dilution from vesting of awards under employee share schemes, cash 
payments relating to transactions involving non-controlling interests and 
currency translation differences relating to cash and cash equivalents as 
presented on the condensed group cash flow statement.
Technical service contract (TSC) 
Technical service contract is an arrangement through which an oil and gas 
company bears the risks and costs of exploration, development and 
production. In return, the oil and gas company receives entitlement to 
variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the 
costs incurred and a profit margin which reflects incremental production 
added to the oilfield. 
Tier 1 and tier 2 process safety events
Tier 1 events are losses of primary containment from a process of greatest 
consequence – causing harm to a member of the workforce, damage to 
equipment from a fire or explosion, a community impact or exceeding 
defined quantities. Tier 2 events are those of lesser consequence. These 
represent reported incidents occurring within bp’s operational HSSE 
reporting boundary. That boundary includes bp’s own operated facilities 
and certain other locations or situations.
Tight oil and gas
Natural oil and gas reservoirs locked in hard sandstone rocks with low 
permeability, making the underground formation extremely tight.
Transition growth
Activities, represented by a set of now retired (as of February 2025) 
transition growth engines, that transition bp toward its objective to be an 
integrated energy company, and that comprise our low carbon activity « 
alongside other businesses that support transition, such as our power 
trading and marketing business and convenience.
Transition  businesses
Business activities (including development, production/manufacture/
generation and marketing, distribution and trading) associated with 
products and services that support energy transition, including in the areas 
of biogas, biofuels, EV charging, renewable power generation, hydrogen and 
carbon capture.

Transition growth investment
Capital investment in relation to transition growth «.
UK National Balancing Point
A virtual trading location for sale, purchase and exchange of UK natural gas. 
It is the pricing and delivery point for the Intercontinental Exchange natural 
gas futures contract.
Ultra fast / Ultra-fast charging 
Electric vehicle charging of greater than or equal to 150kW.
Unconventionals
Resources found in geographic accumulations over a large area, that 
usually present additional challenges to development such as low 
permeability or high viscosity. Examples include shale gas and oil, coalbed 
methane, gas hydrates and natural bitumen deposits. These typically 
require specialized extraction technology such as hydraulic fracturing or 
steam injection.
Underlying effective tax rate (ETR) 
Non-IFRS measure. The underlying ETR is calculated by dividing taxation on 
an underlying replacement cost (RC) basis by underlying RC profit or loss 
before tax. Taxation on an underlying RC basis for the group is calculated 
as taxation as stated on the group income statement adjusted for taxation 
on inventory holding gains and losses and adjusting items total taxation. 
Information on underlying RC profit or loss is provided below. Taxation on 
an underlying RC basis presented for the operating segments is calculated 
through an allocation of taxation on an underlying RC basis to each 
segment. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the underlying ETR because 
this measure may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same 
manner as management, the underlying trends in bp’s operational 
performance on a comparable basis, period on period. Taxation on an 
underlying RC basis and underlying ETR are non-IFRS measures. The 
nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is the ETR on profit or loss for 
the period. 
We are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for 
underlying ETR to ETR on profit or loss for the period, because without 
unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting 
items required to present a meaningful comparable IFRS forward-looking 
financial measure. These items include the taxation on inventory holding 
gains and losses and adjusting items, that are difficult to predict in advance 
in order to include in an IFRS estimate. A reconciliation to IFRS information 
is provided on page 360.
Underlying operating expenditure
Non-IFRS measure. A subset of production and manufacturing expenses 
plus distribution and administration expenses and excludes costs that are 
classified as adjusting items. It represents the majority of the remaining 
expenses in these line items but excludes certain costs that are variable, 
primarily with volumes (such as freight costs). Other variable costs are 
included in purchases in the income statement. Management believes that 
underlying operating expenditure is a performance measure that provides 
investors with useful information regarding the company’s financial 
performance because it considers these expenses to be the principal 
operating and overhead expenses that are most directly under their control 
although they also include certain foreign exchange and commodity price 
effects. The nearest IFRS measures are production and manufacturing 
expenses and distributions and administration expenses. A reconciliation of 
production and manufacturing expense plus distribution and administration 
expenses to underlying operating expenditure is provided on page 363.
Underlying  production
Production after adjusting for acquisitions and divestments and entitlement 
impacts in our production-sharing agreements (PSAs). 2024 underlying 
production, when compared with 2023, is production after adjusting for 
acquisitions and divestments, curtailments, and entitlement impacts in our 
production-sharing agreements/contracts and technical service contract.
Underlying  replacement  cost (RC) profit or loss / underlying RC 
profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders
Non-IFRS measure. RC profit or loss « (as defined above) after excluding 
net adjusting items and related taxation. See page 313 for additional 
information on the adjusting items that are used to arrive at underlying RC 
profit or loss in order to enable a full understanding of the items and their financial impact. Underlying RC profit or loss before interest and tax for the 
operating segments or customers & products businesses is calculated as 
RC profit or loss (as defined above) including profit or loss attributable to 
non-controlling interests before interest and tax for the operating segments 
and excluding net adjusting items for the respective operating segment or 
business.
bp believes that underlying RC profit or loss is a useful measure for 
investors because it is a measure closely tracked by management to 
evaluate bp’s operating performance and to make financial, strategic and 
operating decisions and because it may help investors to understand and 
evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp’s 
operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period, by 
adjusting for the effects of these adjusting items. The nearest equivalent 
measure on an IFRS basis for the group is profit or loss attributable to bp 
shareholders. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for 
segments and businesses is RC profit or loss before interest and taxation. 
A reconciliation to IFRS information is provided on page 360 for the group 
and pages 28-37 for the segments.
Underlying RC profit or loss per share and underlying RC profit or 
loss per ADS
Non-IFRS measures. Earnings per share is defined in Note 11. Underlying 
RC profit or loss per ordinary share is calculated using the same 
denominator as earnings per share as defined in the consolidated financial 
statements. The numerator used is underlying RC profit or loss attributable 
to bp shareholders rather than profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders. 
Underlying RC profit or loss per ADS is calculated as outlined above for 
underlying RC profit or loss per share except the denominator is adjusted to 
reflect one ADS equivalent to six ordinary shares. bp believes it is helpful to 
disclose the underlying RC profit or loss per ordinary share and per ADS 
because these measures may help investors to understand and evaluate, in 
the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp’s operational 
performance on a comparable basis, period on period. The nearest 
equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is basic earnings per share based on 
profit or loss for the period attributable to bp shareholders. A reconciliation 
to IFRS information is provided on page 360.
upstream
upstream includes oil and natural gas field development and production 
within the gas & low carbon energy and oil production & operations 
segments. References to upstream exclude Rosneft. 
upstream / hydrocarbon plant reliability
bp-operated upstream plant reliability is calculated taking 100% less the 
ratio of total unplanned plant deferrals divided by installed production 
capacity, excluding non-operated assets and bpx energy. Unplanned plant 
deferrals are associated with the topside plant and where applicable the 
subsea equipment (excluding wells and reservoirs). Unplanned plant 
deferrals include breakdowns, which does not include Gulf of America 
weather-related downtime.
upstream unit production costs
upstream unit production costs are calculated as production costs divided 
by units of production. Production costs do not include ad valorem and 
severance taxes. Units of production are barrels for liquids and thousands 
of cubic feet for gas. Amounts disclosed are for bp subsidiaries only and do 
not include bp’s share of equity-accounted entities.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) 
A light sweet crude oil, priced at Cushing, Oklahoma, which serves as a 
benchmark price for purchases of oil in the US.
Working capital 
Movements in inventories and other current and non-current assets and 
liabilities as stated in the group cash flow statement.
